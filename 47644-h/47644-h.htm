<h2 class="break-before">FOREWORD.</h2>


<p>The only excuse I have to offer for the publication
of these desultory and chatty letters in this more permanent
form is that a number of my friends have
requested it. Many of the letters have already appeared
in the columns of <i>The Children's Friend</i>, for
which they were originally written, at the instance of
the Presbyterian Committee of Publication; but I have
included in the volume several letters which were
written for other periodicals, and a considerable number
which have not been published anywhere till now.
Some of them were written hastily, and, as it were, on
the wing, others with more deliberation and care.
Some were intended for young readers, others for older
people. This will account for the differences of style
and subject matter which will strike every one, and
which will be particularly noticeable when the letters
are read consecutively.</p>

<p>In some cases I have drawn the materials, in part,
from other sources besides my own observations, the
main object at times being not originality, but accuracy
and fullness of information. In such cases I have
endeavored to make full acknowledgment of my indebtedness
to other writers.</p>

<p>As most of the letters were written for a denominational
paper, they naturally contain a good many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
references to notable events in the history of the Presbyterian
Church, and to some of the differences between
that church and others in matters of doctrine,
polity and forms of worship. But I trust that in no
case have I felt or expressed a spirit of uncharitable
sectarianism. If any reader should receive the impression
that I have done so in one or two instances, I
request him to suspend judgment till he has read all
the references to such matters contained in the letters.
It will then be seen that if I have had occasion to make
some strictures upon the Anglican and Roman Catholic
Churches, I have not hesitated to make them upon my
own church also, when I have observed, in her worship
or work, things which seemed to argue that she was
untrue in any measure to her principles; and that if I
have criticised the Anglo-Catholic and Roman Catholic
systems as erroneous, I have recognized thankfully the
great evangelical truths embedded in the heart of
Anglican, and even Romish theology, though so sadly
overlaid, and have rejoiced to pay my tribute of praise
to the saintly characters that have been developed
within those bodies in spite of their errors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Pleasant
Memory.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">An</span> American traveller says that a sea voyage, compared
with land travel, is a good deal like matrimony
compared with single blessedness: either decidedly better
or decidedly worse. With me, on my first
voyage to Europe a few years ago, it was,
like my own venture in matrimony, decidedly better. We
sailed from New York on a brilliant day, and nearly all
the way over the weather was bright, bracing, buoyant,
with blue sky above, blue sea beneath, and just enough
motion of the water to give it all the fascination of changing
beauty. Only once or twice did even our least seasoned
passengers need "some visible means of support,"
on account of the rolling of the ship, and when we struck
the Gulf Stream, deep blue and warm, it was pleasant on
deck even without wraps, and I remember the captain's
telling me he had seen the temperature of the water
change thirty-one degrees in two minutes, when he would
pass from the Gulf Stream into a colder current, though
we ourselves had no such experience then. Day after day
we lounged on deck restfully, or walked about comfortably,
taking deep and leisurely inhalations of the pure
ocean air, and having frequent opportunity to learn the
meaning of "Cat's Paw" as applied to winds, when, under
the gentle dips of air, the placid ocean took on a pitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
appearance exactly like the tracks made by cats' feet in
soft snow.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Depressing
Start.</div>

<p>Our present voyage has been very different,
and I fear that some of the young people
with me, who are familiar with my impressions of the
former passage, have felt some disappointment with the
ocean. The circumstances of our start were depressing,
notwithstanding the animation of the scene at the North
German Lloyd Pier, with its throng of carriages, baggage
wagons, trucks, trunks, tourists' agents, passengers, and
friends who had come to see them off, and who waved
their handkerchiefs and shouted farewells and sang German
songs, while the band on the <i>Bremen</i> played inspiring
airs, and her own hoarse whistles capped the climax of
the din, as the tugs pulled the great ship out into the
river, and turned her prow towards the ocean, and her
ponderous engines began to throb. It was all in vain.
Nothing could make it seem cheerful. The rain was
pouring steadily and heavily from leaden skies, and just
outside the harbor we ran into an opaque fog that
shrouded all the beauty of the sea, and made it necessary
for the fog horn to sound its prolonged, mournful, ominous,
and nerve-racking blast every minute through the
rest of the day and night, to avoid collision with other
vessels groping through the deep. It was a comfort to
recall the hymn we had used in the family circle the
morning we started from home&mdash;</p>

<p>and to commit ourselves to the care of him who hath
measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
whom the darkness and the light are both alike, and to
whom the night shineth as the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discomforts
at Sea.</div>

<p>For several days the sea was "a gray and
melancholy waste," and, when at length the
weather cleared, a cold wind&mdash;very cold and cutting
and persistent&mdash;blew hard from the northwest, making
our side of the deck intolerable, even with our heaviest
winter clothing and a great profusion of wraps, so that it
was hardly a surprise to us, when about half way over,
to see in the distance what we took to be an iceberg
glistening cold against the horizon&mdash;very interesting, of
course, as compared with the steamships, sailing vessels,
and schools of porpoises, which are the usual variations
of the monotony of the waterscape&mdash;but also very uncomfortable.
Moreover, the wind made the sea so rough at
times that the tables in the dining saloon were more than
once quite "sparsely settled," not a few people "wanted
the earth," and longed for <i>terra firma</i>&mdash;less terror and
more firmer, as a friend of mine once put it. One or two
even of our own party, who, though good "tar heels," are
not equally good "tars," paid reluctant tribute to Neptune.
Reluctant, did I say? Yet it was done eagerly, as though
the persons in question "could not contain themselves"
for joy, or novelty, or some other emotion. I find it
difficult to write of this curious little malady, which
baffles the skill of all physicians, with sufficient plainness,
and, at the same time, with sufficient reserve. The most
delicate reference to it on record was that of a Frenchman,
who, pale and miserable, was greeted by a blooming
Englishman with "Good morning, monsieur, have you
breakfasted?" and replied, "No, monsieur, I have not
breakfasted. On the contrary." Three or four of our
immediate party, however, did not miss a meal on the
whole voyage, but "held their own" throughout, and were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
able to "navigate" every day. Moreover, while the rude
seas robbed us of the exhilaration which I had always
heretofore associated with an ocean voyage, we had on
board many bright and attractive things which went far
to counterbalance the effect of the chilly and depressing
weather.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Life on a German
Steamship.</div>

<p>The <i>Bremen</i> is a staunch and comfortable
ship; not one of the Atlantic greyhounds,
which are built slender and comparatively light in order
to great speed&mdash;but all the better for that, as her vast bulk
and heavy cargo give her a degree of steadiness unknown
to the express steamers, and her appointments are in
every way equal to those of the fastest ships afloat. She
takes nine days for the trip from New York to Southampton,
and in ordinary weather that is none too long for the
average passenger. It was no fault of hers that our
journey was not a comfortable one throughout. It could
not have been so in any ship with such weather as we had
the misfortune to encounter. Of course, everything on
board is German. The stewards can speak enough English
for all necessary purposes, though one of them, when
asked a question by a member of our party, made the
naive reply, "I do not hear well in English." One is soon
initiated into the mysteries of marks and pfennigs, and
begins to pick up sundry guttural German words and
phrases. Being German, of course the ship has plenty of
music, a cornet band discoursing lively airs on deck about
the middle of every forenoon, and a string band playing
during the dinner hour in the saloon, while the passengers
munch in unison. The catering department is organized
on the assumption that the chief occupation of people on
shipboard is eating, sandwiches and hot beef tea being
served on deck in the forenoon, and tea and biscuits of
various kinds in the afternoon, in addition to the three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
very elaborate set meals in the saloon, the lavish abundance
of which is provoking to the squeamish passenger.
A Teutonic bugler, with fully developed lungs, gives the
signals for the meals. On Sunday morning the passengers
are wakened by the strains of Luther's "Ein feste
burg ist unser Gott." The management of the ship
throughout is characterized by German thoroughness, and
the organization and discipline are perfect.</p>

<p>Shuffle board, ring pitching, and other deck games,
and letter-writing, chess, and other amusements indoors,
more or less innocent, serve to while away part of the
time. Ordinarily, reading is my main resource in this
way, but the cold weather and searching draughts, making
it impossible to find a reasonably comfortable spot to sit
down in with a book, reduced my reading on this trip to a
minimum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Unification
of the World.</div>

<p>Various nationalities were represented in
our ship's company, the Anglo-Saxon predominating.
This reminds me of the fact that the ocean
has played no small part in the unification of the world as
thus far accomplished. Nothing, perhaps, distinguishes
the modern world more sharply from the ancient than its
views of the ocean. To the ancients the sea was a mystery
and a terror; it was a barrier, it separated men. To the
moderns the sea is a highway, a means of communication,
it unites men. The nearest approach to a unification of
the race in ancient times was effected by the law of the
Roman and the language of the Greek. The unifying
force to-day is the Anglo-Saxon, who to the genius of the
Roman for conquest and government, and to the genius
of the Greek for letters and art, has added the genius of
the Ph&oelig;nician for commerce and the genius of the Hebrew
for religion. Here we touch the secret of his ascendancy.
The Anglo-Saxon civilization is <i>Christian</i>. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
language is becoming the universal language. His institutions
are becoming the universal institutions. His
ships carry the passengers and produce of the world.
His capital dominates commerce. London is the
clearing-house of the world. Will this unification continue?
Will it endure? It will if the religion to which
the Anglo-Saxon owes his preëminence remains preëminent
in his civilization. The brotherhood of man&mdash;how
else shall it ever be fully and permanently brought about,
except through men's knowledge of the Fatherhood of
God? And how can the Fatherhood of God ever be
known except through him who taught us to say, "Our
Father," and of whom the Father said, "This is my beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him?"
It is no accident that the nations which have most reverently
heeded this divine command, the nations which are
most truly Christian, are the nations which have hitherto
stood in the forefront of the foremost civilizations of mankind,
and are the nations which now hold the future.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>The force which will bind all men in a real and permanent

it Anglo-Saxon commerce, laws, or language; it is the
Christian religion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">All's Well That

<p>The latter part of our voyage was less trying
than the earlier, and the days were generally
brighter, though still cold. Yet all were glad when
one night, about nine o'clock, the intermittent gleam of
the lighthouse on the Scilly Islands came into view, assuring
us that the voyage would soon be ended. Next morning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
we were steaming along the picturesque south coast
of England, with the white chalk cliffs and velvety green
downs in plain view through the tender blue haze, the
water was quieter and the weather warmer, and in a few
hours more we entered The Solent, passing on our right,
almost within a stone's throw, "The Needles," three white,
pointed rocks of chalk, at the western extremity of the
Isle of Wight, which rest on dark colored bases and spring
abruptly from the sea to a height of a hundred feet, and
which are in striking contrast with the vertically striped
cliffs of red, yellow, green, and grey sandstone behind
them.</p>

<p>At last the great engines cease their throbbing for the
first time in nine days, the tender comes alongside for
the passengers bound for Great Britain, and in another
half hour we set foot on the soil of England, in the ancient
city of Southampton.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Visit to the Town of Dr. Isaac Watts.</span></p>


<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">Southampton, England</span>, <i>June 28, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Southampton</span>, the ancient seaport at which travellers
to Europe by the steamships of the North German
Lloyd line first set foot on British soil, is a place of
considerable interest at any time, but was especially attractive
to us after a cold and uncomfortable voyage across
the Atlantic. The day of our arrival was fine, with blue
sky and genial sunshine, the water of the Solent, between
the Isle of Wight and the mainland, was free from the
ocean swell, and Southampton Water was quieter still, so
we landed with thankful hearts and rising spirits. The
city, which is a place of some 70,000 inhabitants, owes its
importance to its sheltered harbor and to the phenomenon
of double tides, which prolong high water for two hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical
Interest of
Southampton.</div>

<p>This mention of the tides reminds me to say
that Southampton is the place where Canute
the Dane is said to have given his famous
rebuke to his flattering courtiers. All the children who
have read any English history will recall the story.</p>

<p>They are familiar, too, with the hard-hearted action
of William the Conqueror in laying waste an area of one
hundred and forty square miles in this neighborhood for
the purpose of making a hunting ground, which has ever
since been known as the New Forest, and which still
stretches westward from Southampton Water. It will
be remembered that the Conqueror's son and successor,
William Rufus, met his death here, being found one day
in these woods with an arrow through his heart. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
arrow may have been shot by one of the many peasants
who had been driven from their homes when the New
Forest was made, though most writers attribute the deed,
without sufficient proof, to a gentleman named Walter
Tyrrell. At any rate, here William Rufus was killed, and
at Winchester, thirteen miles from Southampton, he was
buried under the floor of the cathedral, "many looking on
and few grieving," as the old chronicler says.</p>

<p>Of still more interest to young readers, especially boys,
who are familiar with Sir Walter Scott's stories, <i>The
Talisman</i> and <i>Ivanhoe</i>, is the fact that the Crusaders
under Richard the Lion Hearted, sailed from Southampton
for the Holy Land. That was in 1189.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1620, however, a far more important
expedition, though far less spectacular, was fitted out at
Southampton by the hiring of a ship here called the <i>Mayflower</i>,
in which shortly afterwards the Pilgrim Fathers
sailed for the New World.</p>

<p>It will be seen, then, that Southampton is a place of no
small historical interest, to say nothing of its associations
with Edward III., Henry V., and Charles I., or its being
the birthplace of Sir John E. Millais, the artist, or of its
having fine statues of Lord Palmerston and "Chinese"
Gordon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief Distinction
of the Town.</div>

<p>But it was not on account of any of these
things that we determined to give to this
place the first few hours we were to spend in England.
The special reason for our interest in Southampton is that
it was the birthplace and residence of the greatest hymn
writer that ever lived, a man of totally different physique,
character, gifts, and influence from the able, but bloody
kings with whose names the earlier history of the place
is associated, a small, delicate, scholarly, Christian man,
of lovely spirit, who, by exactly antipodal methods, has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
established a wider, more real, more beneficent, and more
lasting reign over human hearts than William or Richard
were able to achieve&mdash;the Rev. Isaac Watts, D. D.,
whose simpler pieces for children have become household
words throughout the English-speaking world, such as,
"Hush, my dear, lie still and slumber," "Let dogs delight
to bark and bite," "How doth the little busy bee improve
each shining hour," etc., and who, as even a supercilious
and grudging critic like Matthew Arnold admitted, wrote
the finest hymn in the English language, "When I survey
the wondrous cross," and very many others of scarcely
inferior merit.</p>

<p>He was the author of various able treatises on philosophy
and theology, but it was the thought of what he
had done for the world by his hymns that caused us to
stop at Southampton. So, mounting the winding stairway
to the top of the "double-decker" electric tram car,
much better adapted to sightseeing than our single-story
street cars in America, we were carried smoothly and
quickly up the bright and busy High Street, gaily decorated
for the Coronation, and in a few minutes passed
under the great stone arch of the Bar Gate, the most
interesting portion of the ancient city wall. The modern
city, of course, stretches far beyond the walls, street after
street of clean and attractive houses, with a profusion of
brilliant flowers and neatly trimmed greenery, shut in
from the street, in many cases, by high stone walls, over
which, however, we can easily see from our elevated
position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sketch of the
Great Hymn-Writer.</div>

<p>Presently, in the centre of a small park, which opens
on the left with velvety grass and fine trees, we see the
object of our search, a marble statue of a very small and
wizened man, of benevolent face and venerable appearance,
with a Bible in his hand, and on the pedestal in bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
letters the name, "<span class="smcap">Rev. Isaac Watts, D.D.</span>"
He was born in 1674, was devoted to books
from his infancy, and began to learn Latin
when four years old. Afterwards, as a youth he became
so proficient at school that friends proposed to provide
for his support at the university (he was the eldest of nine
children, and the family, while not indigent, was not rich),
but he declined the offer because he could not conscientiously
belong to the Church of England. He cast in his
lot with the Dissenters, and became one of the promoters
of that mighty and beneficent force in English religious
and political life known as "the Nonconformist Conscience."
That his education did not suffer from the
choice he then made is clear from his later work. Dr.
Samuel Johnson, who was a stiff Churchman, with no
love for Dissenters in general, is constrained, in his work
on <i>English Poets</i>, to pay a warm tribute to Dr. Watts'
remarkable attainments, and says it was with great propriety
that in 1728 he received from Edinburgh and
Aberdeen an unsolicited diploma, by which he became a
doctor of divinity. Dr. Johnson adds a remark, which is
commended to the earnest attention of American colleges,
which have done so much to bring honorary degrees into
contempt by their promiscuous bestowment, "Academical
honors would have more value, if they were always bestowed
with equal judgment." He says further that Dr.
Watts was one of the first authors that taught the Dissenters
to court attention by the graces of language. "Whatever
they had among them before, whether of learning or
acuteness, was commonly obscured and blunted by coarseness
and inelegance of style. He showed them that zeal
and purity might be expressed and enforced by polished
diction."</p>

<p>Of his talents in general the same discriminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
writer says that "perhaps there was nothing in which he
would not have excelled if he had not divided his powers
to different pursuits," and of his character, that he admired
Dr. Watts' meekness of opposition and mildness of
censure in theological discussion (qualities which no one
could attribute to Dr. Johnson himself), and that it was
not only in his book, but in his mind, that <i>orthodoxy</i> was
<i>united</i> with <i>charity</i>. Dr. Johnson concludes his appreciation
of him with this remark, "Happy will be that
reader whose mind is disposed, by his verses or his prose,
to imitate him in all but his nonconformity," which shows
both his exalted estimate of the man and his amusing
dislike of the Dissenter. But in nothing was the greatness
of Dr. Watts' character more clearly shown than in his
nonconformity; and his countrymen have continued to
take his view of that matter in ever-increasing numbers,
so that now more than half of the English people are nonconformists.
But of that I shall have something to say at
another time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Salisbury, Sarum, and Stonehenge.</span></p>


<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, <i>June 30, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">For</span> one who visits England as a student of history
there is hardly a better starting point than Southampton,
as the most impressive of the Druidical and
Roman remains in Great Britain are less than forty miles
away, the capital city of Alfred the Great is only twelve
miles distant, the whole surrounding region is closely
associated with the Saxon, Danish, Norman and Plantagenet
kings, and two of the most interesting cathedrals
in England are within easy reach by rail. One of these
cathedral towns, Salisbury, we selected as a suitable place
in which to spend quietly our first Sunday in the Old
World, having landed at Southampton Saturday afternoon.
So, after we had given a few hours to the principal
sights of Southampton, we took a train for Salisbury,
twenty-nine miles distant, and, after a short and delightful
journey through the tranquil rural scenery, which is characteristic
of Southern England, reached our destination
refreshed rather than wearied by our experiences since
leaving the ship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fascinating
Cathedral
Town.</div>

<p>We recognized the place, even before our
train stopped, by the cathedral spire, which
is 406 feet high, the loftiest in England, and
which dominates all views of the town. This richly
adorned spire is one of three things which entitles this
cathedral to special attention, the other two being, first, its
lovely close, unsurpassed in size and beauty, a glorious
expanse of velvety sward, shaded by lofty trees; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
secondly, the uniformity and harmony of its architecture,
making it the most symmetrical and graceful of all English
cathedrals. The interior is less interesting, having
no wealth of monuments like Winchester, Westminster,
and St. Paul's, and no profusion of stained glass windows
like York.</p>

<p>On Sunday we attended service in the cathedral, and
found it formal, cold and unsatisfying. I yield to no man
in my admiration of the beauty of these vast and venerable
cathedrals, but they have been in some respects a hindrance
to vital religion, as I shall endeavor to show in a
later letter. This one at Salisbury was erected in the
middle of the thirteenth century, so that for six hundred
and fifty years it has been used continuously as a place of
Christian worship, first Romish and now Anglican.</p>

<p>But on Monday we made an excursion which took us
back to a still more remote antiquity. One mile to the
north of Salisbury at Old Sarum (a name well known to
students of English politics as that of the "rotten borough,"
which till 1832 had the privilege of sending two
members to Parliament, though without a single inhabitant),
crowning a great hill which commands the surrounding
country for miles, stands the vast, grass-clad
earthworks of an ancient Roman fortress, the largest
entrenched camp in the kingdom. That is old, but we are
bound for something older still, and so we continue our
drive northwards.</p>

<p>One great charm of the summer in Great Britain is the
cool weather. The English people never have to endure
the withering heats to which we are subjected in
America. This year it has been much cooler even than
usual. So, as we drive on through the June day, although
the sun is shining brightly, the air is bracing and exhilarating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Rural Scenery
in Southern
England.</div>

<p>Another marked difference between this
country and most parts of ours is the extraordinary
finish of the landscape, due to
scantiness of forests, absence of undergrowth, thoroughness
of tillage, and especially the luxuriance and smoothness
of the turf. The quiet beauty of rural England has a
perpetual charm. When I was here some years ago it was
May, the hawthorn hedges were in bloom, and the whole
country was robed in tender green. Before landing this
time I felt some regret that we should not see it in the
same lovely attire, thinking of the difference between
early May and late June in America. But I find it even
more beautiful than when I first saw it. The farmers
were cutting the lush grass in some places, impregnating
the air with the delicious fragrance of new-mown hay.
In other fields the wheat was standing thick, with here
and there a blaze of scarlet poppies, sometimes an acre
or two in extent, a solid mass of brilliant red, no green or
other color visible at all. Still prettier, if possible, are the
scattered poppy blooms in a field of half ripe grain, looking
like ruby bubbles on a gently moving, sunlit sea.</p>

<p>The youngsters in our party are interested to see
horses hitched tandem to the wide hay wains in the fields,
and to observe that when we meet a double team in the
road, instead of being harnessed as two horses are with
us, on each side of a tongue, here each of the two horses
is in his own pair of shafts. Nor are they slow to observe
that teams always turn to the left in passing each other,
instead of to the right as with us, and the same rule is
observed in the running of trains on a double track railway.</p>

<p>No frame houses are to be seen in town or country.
We have not seen a wooden house since we landed. All
are of brick or stone, though many of them in the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
are covered with thatch, sometimes with clay tiles. But
slate is more and more superseding these old-fashioned
materials. This does not promote the cottager's comfort.
Slate roofs are hotter in summer and colder in winter than
those of straw, and, of course, too, they are far less picturesque.
I observe that many farmers thatch even their
stone and brick fences to prevent the water from coming
in and freezing, to the injury of the masonry. No wooden
fences are seen, and few of wire. They are either living
hedges of thorn or privet or the like, or they are walls of
stone or brick. In short, the improvements look more
substantial than ours, the agricultural methods more
thorough, the country more finished, and, I should think,
more comfortable to live in, in the material sense. Very
striking is the universal love of flowers. Every little
village yard, if but three or four feet wide, and every
cottage window, however humble, has its rows of brilliant
geraniums, and other ornamental plants.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Impressiveness
of Stonehenge.</div>

<p>And now, after a drive of nine miles, we
reach Salisbury Plain, a name familiar to
me from early boyhood from the title of a little book that
used to be read in many homes, <i>The Shepherd of Salisbury
Plain</i>. As we came up, sure enough, there was a
shepherd on one of the green slopes, with his flock and his
shepherd dog. We give them but a glance, however, for
our attention is instantly claimed by the object which we
have come so far to see, Stonehenge, "the most imposing
megalolithic monument in Britain," a group of great
stones which seem originally to have been arranged in
two concentric circles enclosing two ellipses, but some are
now fallen. Of the outer circle, which was one hundred
feet in diameter, seventeen stones are still standing, with
six of the great cap-stones over them. The largest uprights
of the whole group, those near the centre of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
circle, were twenty-two and a half feet high, and the
transverse blocks were three and a half feet thick. These
are, therefore, quite large stones, but it is not their size
that gives them their interest. The ancient Egyptians
handled much larger stones than these. It is their antiquity,
and the mystery, still unsolved, as to the purpose
for which they were erected. Were they placed here by
the Druids? If so, for what purpose? The name does
not help us, <i>Stonehenge</i> being but a corruption of the
Saxon name, meaning "hanging stones." Were they intended
for a temple of the sun, or a calendar in stone for
the measurement of the solar year, or a huge gallows on
which defeated enemies were hung in honor of Woden,
or a sepulchral circle connected with the burial of the
dead? No positive answer can be given, but the last
mentioned view is now regarded as the most probable,
and is confirmed by the existence in the immediate vicinity
of great turf-covered barrows, or burial places. These
barrows are of the Bronze Age, and to this same remote
period Stonehenge itself is referred by the best authorities.</p>

<p>The present owner of Salisbury Plain has recently
enclosed Stonehenge with a wire fence and charges an
admission fee of a shilling. The public resents this in the
case of a unique and world-renowned monument, which
for ages has stood in the open, freely accessible to all, and
there was not a little satisfaction at finding that, as a sort
of road ran along within a few feet of it, and as the
closing or moving of this thoroughfare could not be permitted
by the county authorities, the fence in question
had to run so close to the famous cromlech, after all, that
the proposed exclusion of the public without payment of a
fee has amounted to very little. Visitors can come so
near, and can get so good a view of all that is to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
be seen that but few pay the fee and go inside the enclosure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Things of
Interest about
Salisbury.</div>

<p>We return to Salisbury by a different road,
which takes us for miles through the meadows
of one of those "sweet and fishful
rivers," which add so much to the quiet charm of the
scenery, placid and clear, flowing softly not only between
grassy banks but over grassy beds, the grass growing
luxuriantly from the bottom, and being cut from the
stream by the hay harvesters, as though it were on the
open meadow.</p>

<p>On reaching the town, I went to the Market Square
to see the bronze statue of a man for whom I had always
felt respect and admiration since studying his work on
Political Economy when I was a student in college, Mr.
Fawcett, a talented native of this place, who, though he
had the misfortune to lose his sight early in life, by the
accidental discharge of a gun in the hands of his own
father, nevertheless became a student, a professor, an
author, a man of affairs, a member of Parliament, and
Postmaster-General of Great Britain&mdash;a fine example of
the triumph of character and will over grievous limitations.</p>

<p>It added to the interest of our visit to Salisbury, and
especially of our walk through the lovely grounds of the
Bishop's Palace, to see this dignitary of the Church of
England in his clerical garb, with apron, knee breeches,
and all, except that he was bareheaded, romping delightedly
on the lawn with a little girl, probably his granddaughter,
and to recollect that the Bishop of Salisbury,
after bringing the wealth of his undoubted scholarship
to his recent book, <i>The Ministry of Grace</i>, had declared,
like Dean Stanley, Bishop Lightfoot and Dean
Milman, that "throughout the early church, even at Rome,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
and Alexandria, down to the third century, the government
of the church was Presbyterian," thus going even
farther than Stanley, who says that "nothing like modern
Episcopacy existed before the beginning of the second
century."</p>

<p>It interested us also to recall that Addison, Fielding,
and Bishop Burnet had resided here. So, considering
these things, and those above mentioned, we all left Salisbury
reluctantly, declaring with one accord that it was an
exceedingly interesting place, and wondering whether
even Winchester could equal it.</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memorials of Kings,
Good and Bad.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Unquestionably</span> the most interesting town in
the south of England to a student of history is
Winchester. It was the ancient capital of the kingdom,
and teems with memories of Alfred the
Great, Canute, William the Conqueror,
and many of their successors. Thorneycroft's fine bronze
statue of Alfred stands in the middle of the High Street,
and instantly catches the eye of any one looking up or
down this central thoroughfare. As we paused in front
of it for a few moments, I had the pleasure of hearing
two little boys from America, who are travelling with me,
recall Alfred's diligence as a student, and his winning of
the book offered by his mother as a prize; his invention
of a candle chronometer, and of the lanthorn, as well as
the familiar incident of the scolding given him by the
neatherd's wife for his negligence in allowing her cakes
to burn. The purity of his character, his self-sacrificing
labors for his people, and the righteousness and prosperity
of his reign have caused him to shine like a star in the
long succession of English kings, who have too often been
selfish, grasping, licentious or tyrannical.</p>

<p>For example, in Winchester Cathedral, close at hand,
lie the remains of Hardicanute, the last Danish monarch,
who died of excessive drinking. The fact that a man is
buried in a cathedral argues nothing here as to his piety.
If he wore the crown, or won battles, or wrote poems, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
is given a place in God's house, regardless of his character.</p>

<p>But, besides men like Hardicanute or William Rufus,
Winchester Cathedral boasts the possession of mortuary
chests containing the bones of Canute, Egbert, Ethelwulf,
and other kings. There is a monumental brass on the
wall in memory of Jane Austen the novelist, who is
buried under the pavement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memorial of the
Gentle Fisherman.</div>

<p>But by far the most interesting thing of
this kind in the cathedral, is the floor
slab which marks the resting place of Izaak Walton, the
Prince of Fishermen (1593-1683), and the author of <i>The
Compleat Angler</i>, concerning which it has been truthfully
said that Walton "hooked a much bigger fish that he
angled for" when he offered his quaint treatise to the
public. There is hardly a name in our literature, even of
the first rank, whose immortality is more secure, or whose
personality is the subject of a more devoted cult. Not
only is he the <i>sacer vates</i> of a considerable sect in the
religion of recreation, but multitudes who have never put
a worm on a hook&mdash;even on a fly-hook&mdash;have been
caught and securely held by his picture of the delights of
the gentle craft and his easy, leisurely transcript of his
own simple, peaceable, loving, and amusing character."
When, on the outbreak of the civil war, he retired from
business as milliner for men in London, he went to a place
in the country which he had bought, but we are told that
he spent most of his time "in the families of the eminent
clergymen of England, of whom he was much beloved."
He married twice, both wives being of distinguished
clerical connection, the second, Anne Ken, sister of
Thomas Ken, afterwards Bishop of Bath and Wells. Of
Thomas Ken we shall have something in particular to say
presently. As we strolled, after supper, along the banks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
of the Itchen, from whose clear and grassy waters Walton
himself had drawn so many fish, it was interesting to
come upon anglers plying his beloved vocation. By the
way, long before the time of Walton, there were people
at Winchester who were fond of fish, and oysters, too.
We read that, before the Reformation, the monks of
Netley Abbey, twelve miles distant, were wont to keep
their brethren at Winchester supplied during Lent with
oysters from Southampton Water, they in return receiving
forty-two flagons of ale weekly.</p>

<p>Enough has been said above to show that no church
in Great Britain, outside of London, is richer in monuments
than Winchester Cathedral. It has also the distinction
of great size, being 556 feet long, the longest nave
in England. But the exterior is heavy, without a suggestion
of the symmetry and grace of Salisbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wit in Winchester
College.</div>

<p>The other "lion" of Winchester, also, has a
very uninviting and even forbidding exterior.
This is the ancient College, a school for boys, where
Alfred himself is said to have been educated, though William
of Wykeham refounded it in 1382. The front of it
looks like a prison, but within the quadrangles, and
stretching far back to the river, are lovely grounds covered
with grass as green and smooth as a velvet carpet. The
best thing I saw here was the following inscription on the
walls of a school-room, accompanied by the painted emblems
which I mention below in brackets:</p>

<p><i>Aut disce.</i> [A mitre and crosier, as the expected rewards
of learning.]</p>

<p><i>Aut discede.</i> [An inkhorn and sword, the emblems of the
civil and military professions.]</p>

<p><i>Manet sors tertia caedi.</i> [A rod.]</p>

<p>Which may be freely translated, "Either learn, or depart
hence, or remain and be chastised," though the pithy, alliterative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rendering in vogue among the boys is better,
"Work, or walk, or be whopped" (<i>h</i> silent in the last
word). American boys would probably have rendered it,
"Learn, or leave, or be licked."</p>

<p>The school has revenues of nearly $100,000 per annum.
There are 420 pupils. A number of them were
having their supper as we passed through the dining-hall,
eating from square beech-wood trenchers instead of
plates, talking in shrill tones, and nudging and pushing
each other just like American boys, unimpressed by the
fact that the heavy, narrow tables from which they were
eating were five hundred years old. How like boys it was
to call the water pipe in the quadrangle, at which they
wash their hands and faces, "Moab," and the place where
they blacked their shoes, "Edom," because in Psalm lx. 8,
it is said, "Moab is my wash-pot, I will cast my shoe over
Edom."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lovely
Churchman.</div>

<p>As we walked through the ancient cloisters
we came upon another characteristically
boyish thing, a name cut on one of the stone pillars in
clear, strong letters&mdash;"Tho Ken 1665"&mdash;and hardly
anything in Winchester interested me so much as this,
for the boy who cut it there, nearly two hundred and fifty
years ago, became afterwards the author of what we call
"the long metre doxology," four lines which have been
sung more frequently than any other four lines in the
English language, and which for generations to come will
express the praise of increasing millions. This doxology
was written by Ken as a concluding stanza to his famous
Morning, Evening and Midnight Hymns, the best known
of which, perhaps, is his evening hymn, "Glory to thee,
my God, this night."</p>

<p>But there are other reasons why it was a pleasure to
be vividly reminded of Ken at Winchester. He was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
man of singularly modest, sweet, and lovable disposition.
Macaulay says that his character approached, "as near as
human infirmity permits, to the ideal perfection of Christian
virtue." Yet he was no weakling, and on two notable
occasions he showed that, mild and gentle as he was, he
was also firm and fearless.</p>

<p>When the profligate Charles II. was at Winchester,
waiting for the completion of his palace there, he requested
Ken, then prebendary at Winchester, to lend his
house temporarily to the notorious Nell Gwynn, the
King's mistress. Ken refused to let such a person have
his house. Charles does not seem to have resented the
affront, for he afterwards made Ken Bishop of Bath and
Wells. It is one of the abominations of the English union
of Church and State, that a thoroughly depraved man like
Charles II., if he succeeds to the throne, becomes <i>ipso
facto</i> the head of the Church of England. By the way,
the altar books in black letter in Winchester Cathedral
were presented to the church by this same graceless
Charles II. Things get badly mixed under such a system
as that of the Church of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ken's Defiance
of James II.</div>

<p>The second occasion on which Ken showed
that, notwithstanding the infelicities of the
national church, she does have men who will stand for
God against the King when necessity arises, was when
James II., without calling Parliament, issued what he
called a declaration for liberty of conscience, the real aim
of which was to put England again under the yoke of
Romanism, and ordered that this declaration should be
read in every cathedral and church in the kingdom. Ken
and six other bishops refused, and they were arrested, and
committed to the Tower of London. Instantly a blaze of
popular indignation burst forth. Enormous crowds assembled
to see the seven bishops embark, the shore was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
covered with crowds of prostrate spectators, who asked
their benediction, as did also the very soldiers sent to
arrest them. The bishops bore themselves well throughout,
and, a few days after, when they were tried in Westminster
Hall, and the verdict "Not guilty" was brought
in, there was a tumultuous outburst of joy. Thus Ken
bore his bold and manly part in the revolution, which
finally swept the Stuarts from the throne, and delivered
England, for the time, from the menace of Romish
domination.</p>

<p>Winchester, then, with her ancient cathedral and her
ancient school, with her Alfred the Great, her Izaak Walton,
and her Thomas Ken, with her wealth of heroic, and
gentle and saintly memories, has given us two of the most
profitable days of our sojourn in Southern England.</p>

</div>

<p>Up to the time of Sir Richard Whittington, in the
sixteenth century, the burning of coal in London was
considered such a nuisance that it was punished by death.
A dispensation to burn coal was first made in favor of
Whittington, and this innovation on his part has affected
the great city, of which he was four times Lord Mayor,
infinitely more than the success of his celebrated venture
in bringing up and selling a cat, which enabled him to lay
the foundation of other investments. Yet the story of the
cat is known to boys and girls the world over, while the
story of the coal is known to comparatively few, even of
their elders.</p>

<p>Coal serves the same purposes in London that it does
elsewhere, of course. But, while elsewhere it warms only
thousands of people, and makes steam for only thousands
of factories, locomotives, and steamboats, here it warms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and works for more than five millions. The output of
smoke from this unparalleled consumption of coal is, of
course, something enormous, and when we consider that
the weather itself is frequently, perhaps I may say generally,
dull, heavy and thick, with an amount of clouds
and rain unknown to our brilliant American climate, it is
not strange that the fogs of London are the thickest and
most dangerous in the world, sometimes producing complete
darkness at midday, and necessitating the lighting
of the gas, as though it were midnight, and at other times
producing a peculiar gloom, which is so impervious to
light itself that the traffic of the streets has to be stopped
for hours. Nor is it strange that the city is begrimed to
an extraordinary degree from one end to the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Æsthetic
Value of Soot.</div>

<p>I have a friend in America, whom I sometimes
jestingly call an "Anglomaniac,"
because he admires Great Britain and her belongings so
much. I once accused him of trying to convince me that
the sky was bluer and the grass greener in Canada than
in the United States&mdash;and who speaks of the blackness
of the London buildings as "richness." It is interesting
to find that he is supported in this view by some of the
best writers on London. Hare, for instance, in speaking
of St. Paul's Cathedral, emphasizes this point, "Sublimely
impressive in its general outlines, it has a peculiar sooty
dignity all its own, which, externally, raises it immeasureably
above the fresh, modern-looking St. Peter's at Rome.
G. A. Sala says, in one of his capital papers, that it is
really the better for 'all the incense which all the chimneys
since the time of Wren have offered at its shrine, and are
still flinging up every day from their foul and grimy
censers.' Here and there only is the original grey of the
stone seen through the overlaying blackness." Nathaniel
Hawthorne, too, says, "It is much better than staring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
white; the edifice would not be nearly so grand without
this drapery of black." By the way, the whole cost of
St. Paul's, which was nearly four million dollars, was
paid by a tax on every chaldron of coal brought into the
port of London, "on which account it is said that the
cathedral has a special claim of its own to its smoky
exterior."</p>

<p>Whatever one may think of these views, as to the
æsthetic value of soot on great stone buildings like St.
Paul's, it must be admitted by all that London, as a whole,
is intensely ugly. Henry James, speaking of one of the
fashionable quarters of the city, says, "As you walk along
the streets, you look up at the brown brick house-walls,
corroded with soot and fog, pierced with their straight,
stiff window-slits, and finished, by way of cornice, with a
little black line resembling a slice of curbstone. There is
not an accessory, not a touch of architectural fancy, not
the narrowest concession to beauty." In the indictment
thus brought against one quarter of the city, it will be
observed that there are other counts besides the soot, such
as the monotony and plainness of the architecture and the
character of the building materials, and in both particulars
London does compare very unfavorably with some other
cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Brick vs. Stone.</div>

<p>There are, of course, some very handsome
stone buildings, such as the British Museum,
the new Parliament Buildings, many of the
churches, and some of the government offices and private
residences, but most of the houses are constructed of ugly
brownish yellow brick, and capped with rigid rows of
chimney pots. The same thing is true of English towns
in general, and is one of the most obvious points of inferiority
on their part to the cities and towns of Scotland.
Of Glasgow as it was in the eighteenth century, then, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
course, but a small place in comparison with its present
size, Sir Walter Scott wrote, in <i>Rob Roy</i>, "The principal
street was broad and important, decorated with public
buildings of an architecture, rather striking than correct
in point of taste, and running between rows of tall houses,
built of stone; the fronts of which were occasionally
richly ornamented with mason-work&mdash;a circumstance
which gave the street an imposing air of dignity and
grandeur, of which most English towns are in some
measure deprived, by the slight, unsubstantial, and perishable
quality and appearance of the bricks with which they
are constructed." Of the later Glasgow of his time, Hawthorne
said, "It is the stateliest city in the kingdom." The
adjective was well chosen. Those solid, strong, stone-built
Scotch cities, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and
others, are stately, as no English cities of brick are or can
be; though there is also a suggestion of sombreness or
severity about them, which seems to belong to that dour,
grey land of the North; so that, after all, the Scottish
cities do not afford the strongest contrast to London's
dingy masses of brick. To find that, we must look to
some of the cities of the Continent, especially Paris, the
cleanest, brightest, and most beautiful of all the great
capitals of the world. The Parisian climate is clearer,
there is less fog and smoke, the houses are built of a white
stone that gives the city a singular fairness to the eye,
quite different from the rather gloomy greyness of the
Scottish cities, and, of course, antipodal to the brick and
grime of London. Moreover, the streets of Paris, driven
this way and that through squalid tenement districts by
Baron Hausmann, in his renovation of the city thirty or
forty years ago, are broad and splendid thoroughfares,
abounding in pure air, bright sunlight and green trees, all
as different as possible from the cramped and tortuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
streets and alleys of the British metropolis. "London has
had no aedile like Hausmann." Few things add so much
to the attractiveness of great cities as handsome streets
along the water fronts. In Paris, on both sides of the
Seine throughout its entire course in the city, are broad,
well-paved, and well-shaded <i>Quais</i>, flanked by noble rows
of stone buildings, while in London the Victoria Embankment
is almost the only worthy improvement along the
Thames. This Embankment is unquestionably a fine
work, but as one walks along the broad stone pavement
of it, the view he gets on the other side of the river is
made up principally of dirty wharves and hideous warehouses.</p>

<p>In many respects, also, London is untidy. Orange
peel, paper and trash are much in evidence. Why should
there not be street scavengers like those who keep even
the small towns in France and Germany quite free from
that kind of litter?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Immensity and
Multitude.</div>

<p>Strictly speaking, London is not a city, but,
as Madame de Stael called it, "a province
of brick," and it looks as though it might become a continent,
for, though there are already more people in it than
in the whole of Scotland, and more than twice as many
as in the whole of Norway, it is still growing rapidly. It
has more than three thousand miles of streets. In spreading
thus, the great city has reached out to, and absorbed,
many towns that once stood around it. By the way, this
accounts, to some extent for the fact that so many streets
in London have the same name. I venture to think that
the most preposterous and vexatious system of nomenclature
ever in vogue is that which has been employed for
the streets of London. Until quite recently there were
166 different streets in this city bearing the name of New,
151 Church, 129 Union, 127 York, 119 John, 109 George,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and so on. Of late some part of this infuriating ambiguity

still remains to baffle and puzzle the visitor, and to cause
him the loss of much valuable time and some temper.</p>

<p>I have not flattered London. The picture
drawn above is repulsive. Perhaps some
of my readers are ready to ask whether such a place can
be attractive. Yes. Bulwer says of it, in <i>Ernest Maltravers</i>,
"The public buildings are few, and, for the most
part, mean; the monuments of antiquity not comparable
to those which the pettiest town in Italy can boast of;
the palaces are sad rubbish; the houses of our peers and
princes are shabby and shapeless heaps of bricks. But
what of all this? The spirit of London is in her thoroughfares&mdash;her
population! What wealth&mdash;what cleanliness&mdash;what
order&mdash;what animation! How majestic, and yet
how vivid, is the life that runs through her myriad veins!"
Externally, Paris is incomparably more beautiful than
London, but the fundamental characteristics of the French
people are not to be named with those of the British. The
charm of London is deeper than that of Paris; it wears
better; it lasts longer.</p>

<p>"Sir," said Dr. Johnson to Boswell, as they sat in the
Mitre Tavern, in the centre of the city, "the happiness of
London is not to be conceived, but by those who have been
in it. I will venture to say there is more learning and
science within the circumference of ten miles from where
we sit than in all the rest of the kingdom." And again,
"He who is tired of London is tired of existence."</p>

<p>It is the history of the city and the character of the
people, rather than the shape and color of their houses,
that give London her abiding charm. And, with her vast
treasures of literature, science, and art, what a paradise
the great smoky city is to all readers and students, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
spite of her wretched climate, and her oppressively dingy
<i>tout ensemble</i>!</p>

<p>It is only fair to add that the famous French sculptor,
M. Rodin, has recently been expressing his admiration
for the smoky British metropolis, declaring that "nothing
could be more beautiful than the rich, dark, and ruddy
tones of London buildings, in the grey and golden haze
of the afternoon."</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>July 4, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> is the custom of the American Ambassador to England
to give a reception every year, on the Fourth of
July, to any of his countrymen who may be sojourning in
the British metropolis. Being in London on the recurrence
of that memorable date in 1902, we made it our
special business to attend this reception. It did not differ
from the conventional affair of this kind. Mr. and Mrs.
Choate and their daughter received their guests with
gracious cordiality. The house is a large one, well furnished,
and worthy to be the home of the representative
of the greatest nation in the world. All the great halls,
wide stairways, and spacious parlors were thrown open
as well as the large dining-room, on the first floor, where
refreshments were served, and a wide spreading marquee
on the terrace in the rear, where lively music was discoursed
and these were all filled with people, well
dressed, and, for the most part, well-bred ladies and gentlemen,
the ladies predominating a company so numerous
as to give one a very strong impression of the number
of Americans visiting London in the summer. This season
may, indeed, have been exceptional, as the coronation
of the King had been expected to take place in the latter
part of June. But apart altogether from that, it would
have been a large crowd, and it is certain that, under
ordinary conditions, the number of our people visiting
London steadily increases year by year, and that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
feel at home there, as among their own kith and kin, to a
degree unknown in any other of the European capitals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increasing
Friendliness
between
America and
England.</div>

<p>Speaking by and large, I believe that we
like and trust the British people, and that
they like and trust us. A marked change
has come over the feelings of both peoples
within the last quarter of a century. I
remember well that when I was a boy, the school
histories of the United States had the effect of making
all the American boys hate the English. They were
not informed that many of the English people, including
some of their greatest statesmen, deprecated earnestly
the oppressive acts of the British government which
led to the American Revolution, and that now the people
of Great Britain are practically unanimous in the opinion
that their government was wrong, and the Americans
right in that great conflict. If any reader doubts this, I
beg leave to call his attention to some statements found
in a pamphlet called "Pictures from England's Story,"
which I bought at a London news stand. It belongs to a
series of such works called "Books for the Bairns," which
are written by English authors for the instruction of
English children, and which, though well printed, in clear,
bold type, and copiously illustrated, are sold at the almost
incredibly small price of one penny apiece.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the English
now
View the
American
Revolution.</div>

<p>"Most of the pictures which you will find in
this book are pictures of English victories,
but there is one picture, and that one of
the most significant of all, of an English
defeat. This is the picture of the battle
of Bunker's Hill, that was fought in America. I
want you to take particular notice of that picture, because,
although the English were defeated, it was much
better for them to be defeated than it would have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
for them to have been victorious. You will often be told
that you must always be glad when your country is victorious,
but that is not true, for justice and right are greater
than your country. When your country fights against
justice, and against right, and against liberty, it is fighting
against God, and even if it succeeds for the time being, it
will always suffer in the long run. In the war which began
with the battle of Bunker's Hill, England was in the
wrong. Every one admits that now, but at the time when
it was fought, the King and his ministers, and most of
the people of England, believed that they were in the
right, because it was the cause of England, and England
was the home of liberty, and it seemed to them quite
absurd to think that the American farmers could have
right on their side. But the American farmers were in
the right. They were few, they were poor, they had no
army, they had no king, and they had no parliament, and
it seemed quite impossible to our forefathers of those days
to think that such a small people could possibly stand up
against the armies and the navies of Great Britain. But
Great Britain was in the wrong. The Americans were
the English people who had gone across the sea to make
new homes for themselves in another country, where they
could be free to govern themselves in their own way,
without interference from the British government. They
were good people, honest, hard-working, pious folk, who
had carried with them across the sea the English love of
liberty and self-government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fair Statement
of
the Question
and the
Conflict.</div>

<p>"The English in England had been victorious
in their war against France. They
were governed by a German king, who
was much less in sympathy with English
ideas than were the Americans, and he
believed, and the majority of the English in England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
agreed with him at the time that the Americans
ought to be content to be governed by governors sent out
from England, and should be willing to pay the taxes,
which the English Parliament ordered them to pay. Now
the English have always maintained that no king or government
has a right to compel the people to pay any
money for the support of the government unless the
people consent to pay it. Taxation without representation
is tyranny, and the Americans said, that as they had no
voice in the election of the English Parliament, which
made the taxes, they were not bound to pay them. The
English said, that whether they liked it or not, the Americans
must pay them. The Americans said they would not.
The English said they would make them, and they sent an
army to America to compel the Americans to pay the
taxes, and to obey the King and Parliament. In doing
this they were sinning against the first principle of English
liberty, and the Americans took up arms to defend
their liberty against the English soldiers. They met at
Bunker's Hill, and, to the astonishment of every one, the
undrilled farmers, who knew how to shoot, met and defeated
the disciplined troops of England. England sent
thousands upon thousands of men across the Atlantic;
they defeated the Americans again and again; they
burned their houses; they ravaged their country; they
captured all their cities; but still the Americans went on
fighting, because they were of the true English breed,
and they would rather lose their lives than give up the
independence of their country. They were not independent
at first, they were British colonists; but when they
found themselves attacked by the British, they declared
their independence, and formed themselves into a republic,
without a king, or a House of Lords, or an Established
Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What England
Learned from
Fighting
against
her own
Principles.</div>

<p>"The war went on for long years; it cost
England a hundred millions of money, and
thousands upon thousands of brave soldiers;
but the English were fighting
against their own English principles, which
were defended by George Washington and the Americans
with such bravery and heroism that at last the
English, notwithstanding all their pride, and their wealth,
and their power, had to give in, and own themselves
beaten.... Fortunately, we were defeated, and
from our defeat we learned a great lesson, which we
did not forget for nearly a hundred years. That lesson is
that it is impossible to govern a white, freedom-loving
people except by their own consent. We took that lesson
to heart so much that for nearly a hundred years we never
again attempted to compel our colonists to do anything
they did not want to do. We gave them freedom, and let
them govern themselves upon the true English principles
which George Washington fought for, and which George
III. fought against. The British Empire, of which we
are so proud to-day, exists because the principles of
George III. were knocked on the head at the battle of
Bunker's Hill, and in the long war which followed it....
The United States of America are now a great
nation, which is more numerous and more powerful than
Great Britain."</p>

<p>This candid and manly statement, made by an English
author and published broadcast for the instruction of
English children, is one of the most interesting things I
have encountered in England, and I have thought it worth
while to quote it here in the interests of a still better
understanding between the two great nations of the same
stock, and the same speech, and the same political
ideals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>A slighter indication of the same English breadth of
view in regard to this question was given by the good
ladies who have charge of the pleasant boarding house, on
Torrington Square, which we have made our home on all
our visits to London, and who, on the morning of the
Fourth of July, thought of it themselves, and had a tiny
firecracker lying by the plate of each young American in
our party when we came down to breakfast, besides other
indications later in the day of their readiness, though
themselves staunchly British, to enter sympathetically into
the enthusiasm with which Americans celebrate the natal
day of our nation.</p>

<p>A movement has been started in London to erect a
statue of George Washington. It was decided that the
subscriptions should be confined to British subjects.
Archdeacon Sinclair, in submitting the plan to the (Puritan)
Society, said:</p>

<p>"Englishmen have at last fully recognized the great
qualities of Washington. I feel assured that nothing will
be more popular in this country than such a tribute to that
great man of English birth, who has done so much for the
world's history, not only for the young nation across the
sea, but for Great Britain as well."</p>

<p>Archdeacon Sinclair announced that he was authorized
to offer a place for the statue in St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>But now I find that I have become so much interested
in the statement of this reversal of British sentiment concerning
the American struggle for independence, that I
have left myself no space to speak of the burning question
in England just now, in regard to which the government
has taken a position, extraordinary as this may seem,
which violates the same principles of liberty for which
the Americans fought, and so I must reserve that for another
letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;Since my return to America I have seen an
interesting statement by the Rev. R. J. Campbell, of London,
in regard to the steady increase of the pro-British
feeling in the United States. He says that a book has
just been published by an American barrister named Dos
Passos, called <i>The Anglo-Saxon Century and the Unification
of the English-Speaking People</i>. This gentleman,
although of Spanish origin, is of American birth, and his
interest in the future of his own country had led him to
examine that of ours. He believes that the twentieth
century is to be the Anglo-Saxon century, even more
than the nineteenth, and the conditions of an alliance, as
advocated by him, are as follows:</p>

<p>1. The Dominion of Canada voluntarily to divide
itself into such different States, geographically arranged,
as its citizens desire, in proportion to population, and each
State to be admitted as a full member of the American
Union, in accordance with the conditions of the Constitution
of the United States.</p>

<p>2. To establish common citizenship between all citizens
of the United States and the British Empire.</p>

<p>3. To establish absolute freedom of commercial intercourse
and relations between the countries involved, to
the same extent as that which exists between the different
States constituting the United States of America.</p>

<p>4. Great Britain and the United States to coin gold,
silver, nickel, and copper money, not necessarily displaying
the same devices or mottoes, but possessing the same
money value, and interchangeable everywhere within the
limits covered by the treaty, and to establish a uniform
standard of weights and measures.</p>

<p>5. To provide for a proper and satisfactory arbitration
tribunal to decide all questions which may arise under the
treaty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of this may seem chimerical and unsound, but
there is certainly a feeling in this country which is influencing
things in the direction of a better understanding,
and a consciousness of a common destiny between the
British Empire and the United States. In private one is
constantly meeting with expressions of it, and I may as
well add that nothing has caused me more surprise than
this one fact. One frequently hears the hope expressed
that a common citizenship may one day be possible without
any interference with the constitution of either country.
This is a new idea to me, and may be a fruitful one
some day.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">How the English Regard the Americans.</span></p>


<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>July 10, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> are many indications of a better understanding,
and an increasing confidence and regard between
the two great English-speaking nations on either
side of the Atlantic. One such indication is the marked
change of tone on the part of English writers in their
references to their American cousins. The time was
when, in British books and newspapers, Americans were
uniformly represented as coarse and loud. There are
still too many Americans, at home and abroad, who deserve
to be so described, but the old contemptuous tone
towards Americans in general is found only in an occasional
writer who lives chiefly in the past. For instance,
Mr. Hare, the author of some of the best guide books for
reading people that have ever appeared, such as his <i>Walks
in London</i>, and his <i>Walks in Rome</i>, seems still to regard
the average American as the embodiment of bad taste and
crass ignorance. In his book on Florence, after speaking
of various other hotels, and their picturesque locations,
he says, "Americans may possibly like the Savoy Hotel
in the horrible Piazza Vittorio Emanuele"; and in his
book on Rome he says it is depressing to hear Americans,
when asked their opinion of the Venus de Medici, say,
"they guess they are not particularly gone on stone gals."
But Americans only smile as they read these things,
remembering that Hare is the same man who bewails the
downfall of the papacy as a temporal power, and who
believes that the emancipation and unification of Italy by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Victor Immanuel was a calamity, notwithstanding the
steadily increasing prosperity of the people, and the steadily
rising financial credit of the nation, and notwithstanding
the fact that every unprejudiced observer acknowledges
that the chief hindrance to still more rapid progress
is the swarm of fat priests and monks who still infest
Italy, and in the interest of the papacy oppose the new
and enlightened government at every turn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The English
Admit that
America
Holds the
Future.</div>

<p>In short, Hare's view of the average American
is now such an anachronism as to entitle
him fairly to be called a freak. He certainly
does not represent his countrymen
of to-day in their view of the spirit and
culture of the American people. The usual tone of
English reference to them is not only not contemptuous,
but respectful and friendly, and in the case of
the industrial and commercial enterprise of the Americans
there is even a tinge of fear in the tone in which
the English refer to them. For example, a very able and
candid English editor, in speaking of Mr. Andrew Carnegie's
address as Rector of St. Andrews University, last
October, which he pronounces one of the most remarkable
addresses ever delivered in Great Britain, practically
admits that America has outstripped the mother country
in this respect at least. He says, "Mr. Carnegie is a personage.
A man who has risen from nothing to the summit
of American finance is a man to be reckoned with.
Mr. Carnegie is also a Scotchman, and a devout lover of
his country. It is no pleasure to him to contemplate the
decadence of Great Britain. He is anxious to say the best
he can for our country, and yet the one thing to be noted
in his address is his immense, overpowering faith in
America.... She has such resources, and is increasing
so rapidly that nothing can stand against her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
Britain's employers are wanting in energy and enterprise,
and the employed think too much of how little they need
do, and too little of how much they can do. Britain may
maintain her present trade, but America will in the lifetime
of many people have a population equal to that of
Europe to-day, excluding Russia. America is not an
armed camp, as Europe is. It is one united whole at
peace with itself, and enjoys immunity from attack, while
in machinery its position is far ahead of others....
That a man so shrewd, successful and experienced as
Mr. Carnegie, and so well disposed towards Britain,
should have come reluctantly to the conclusion that for
Britain there is no future, and for America there is the
future of the world, is a fact of first-rate significance, and
we should like to see how he is to be answered." This is
a remarkably candid statement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English Candor
and English
Inconsistency.</div>

<p>In my last letter I said that the English people
now frankly acknowledge that their
forefathers were wrong in the war they
waged against the American colonies, and openly rejoice
in the victory achieved by Washington and his associates
on behalf of the principle of no taxation without representation,
and I referred in closing to what seems to be a
strange inconsistency on the part of many of the English
people in upholding a policy at the present time, which
involves a violation of the same principle. The thing
referred to was the new Education Bill, perfidiously introduced
into Parliament by the Tory party, at the instigation
of certain leaders of the Anglican Church, at a
time when that party had an overwhelming majority in
the House of Commons, a majority given it by the country
for the specific purpose of bringing the war in South
Africa to a speedy and successful close, and when the
electors never dreamed of that majority being used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
promote sectarianism, and to oppress the consciences of a
great body of the people. The object of the bill is to tax
the whole population of England for the support of
schools which are controlled, not by the people, but by
the ritualistic clergy of the Anglican Church, or, as an
evangelical clergyman of that church himself puts it, the
intention of the measure is "to hand the education of the
coming generations over to the Romanizing priesthood of
the Anglican Church." The mere suggestion of public
support without public control ought to rouse the indignation
of a free people. But the bill proposes a worse thing
even than this, so far as the Nonconformists are concerned,
for they are not only to be asked to pay for the
support of a religion they do not believe in, but also to
hand over their children to its teachers, in order that they
may be perverted. In other words, they are to be asked
to pay for the destruction of their own religion.</p>

<p>However apathetic some Englishmen may be in the
face of such proposals, that is the sort of thing that never
fails to rouse liberty-loving Scotland, and so, along with
the earnest denunciations of the bill by various organizations
of English Free Churchmen, it has been heartily
condemned by all the great religious bodies of Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scotchmen and the
Education Bill.</div>

<p><i>Saint Andrew</i>, as the weekly organ of
the Church of Scotland is called, says
as to the origin, spirit and purpose of the measure, "There
is no real meaning in calling the party in the English
Church, which is at present the most indefatigable, the
'High Church' party. The party is Romanist, pure and
simple; and it is devoting itself to the uprooting of the
Protestantism of the young people of England....
Can we wonder at the intelligent Nonconformist revolting
against his children being brought under the fatally sinister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
influence here referred to, and knowing the close connection
between church and school, resolving that he will
resist, with all his might, the perpetuation of a system in
which general control of the public schools shall be in the
hands of men who openly inculcate the doctrine of the
corporeal presence, baptismal regeneration, prayers for
the dead, the duty of confession, adoration of the cross;
and who beguile the children of their schools to attend
'the sacrifice of the mass,' with the incense and candles,
and all the other paraphernalia under which they have
disguised the Lord's Supper?"</p>

<p>The folly of the Anglicans in this matter will hasten
the fall of the Established Church of England. And in
any case the Nonconformists will not have long to wait,
for they are steadily and rapidly gaining ground. In
1700 Dissenters were, in comparison with Churchmen,
one to twenty-two, in 1800, one to eight, and in 1900,
one to one. That shows that the day is not distant when
real religious liberty shall be established in England, and
all such bigoted legislation as this present Education Bill
shall be swept from her statute books. Meantime, it is
certain that it will go on the books, notwithstanding its
glaring injustice. There is not a doubt that Mr. Balfour's
government will push the measure through, by means of
the votes of its great war majority. The consequence
will be that thousands of Nonconformists will refuse to
pay the rates, then the King's officers will seize and sell
some of their property, and perhaps numbers of them will
see the inside of prison walls before all is over. But they
will make history in England. For, when men are sold
out and imprisoned for the sake of conscience and religious
liberty and a historic English principle, viz., that of
public control of public funds&mdash;when these things occur,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
an idea will begin to penetrate to the average English
mind, the English sense of fair play will be roused, and
the English zeal for liberty kindled anew, to say nothing
of the English instinct of self-preservation&mdash;and then
the day of reckoning will have come.</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>July 15, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> nominal ruler of the British Empire is His
Majesty, Edward VII. The real ruler is the House
of Commons. Though I was in Great Britain at the time
of the coronation, and saw something of the pomp with
which it was celebrated, I have not thought it worth while
to occupy the time of my readers with descriptions of it,
since it is only one of those glittering fictions which the
English people see fit to preserve, notwithstanding their
general good sense&mdash;a somewhat childish observance of
outworn mediæval ceremonies, a foolish and expensive
form. But certainly I ought not to quit the subject of
the political ideas suggested by a sojourn in London, and
especially by repeated visits to that most interesting
portion of it, Westminster, without some reference to the
part it has played in developing the model of all the free
governments of the world. For, as a British writer has
truly said, Westminster is historically the centre of politics,
not for London and Great Britain only, but for the
civilized world. "All civilized nations, both in Europe
and America, as well as all the British colonies, have now
adopted the constitution which was here founded and
developed, with a single head of the State and two chambers;
though, with regard to the headship of the State
and the upper chamber, the elective has, in the most
advanced politics, been substituted for the hereditary
principle, while in the cases of the United States and
Switzerland there is a federal as well as a national element.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
The Roman imposed his institutions with arms
upon a conquered world; a willing world has adopted the
institutions which had their original seat at Westminster.
But the British Constitution now means little more than
the omnipotence of the House of Commons. The immense
edifice is still styled the palace; but the King who
now dwells in the palace is the sovereign people."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Houses
of Parliament.</div>

<p>For this reason it is more common now to
speak of the Palace of Westminster as the
Houses of Parliament. It is a vast and costly pile, one of
the largest Gothic buildings in the world, erected about
fifty years ago, in the Tudor style, at an outlay of
fifteen million dollars. The extremely florid exterior is
constructed of a limestone so perishable that already it
costs ten thousand dollars a year to keep it in repair.
Tastes differ as to the merit of the architecture. Some
pronounce the building majestic and imposing. Others
say that at a little distance the river front looks like a
large modern cotton mill. All agree that there is too much
elaborate ornamentation.</p>

<p>This is true of the interior, as well as the exterior,
and, as some one has said, it is interesting to observe the
attempt made to preserve a constitutional fiction by decorating
with special gorgeousness that Chamber of the
House which has been stripped of all its power, viz., the
House of Lords. It is resplendent in the vivid red leather
which covers the seats and backs of the straight benches,
rising in tiers on the opposite sides, and in the sumptuous
frescoes of the walls, the rich stained glass of the windows,
and the excessive gilding of the ceiling. The
leather on the benches in the House of Commons is black,
and there is less of magnificence in general than in the
Chamber of the Peers, though it also is a rich interior.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and grandeur, and, to one who has seen the noble
halls in which our Senate and House of Representatives
sit at Washington, both of these legislative chambers of
Britain seem small and cramped. They are also mean
and uncomfortable in their arrangements as compared
with those of our Congress. At Washington each member
has his own chair, and a desk for his books and
papers. But here there are no desks, only rigid benches,
upon which the members sit or loll, facing each other
across the narrow chamber, the supporters of the government
on the Speaker's right, and the opposition on his
left. Worst of all is the fact that, though the combined
science of the country was employed in the construction
of these halls of session and debate, they are both wretched
failures as to ventilation and acoustics, the House of
Lords being so bad in the latter particular that it used to
be said that members went out to buy an evening paper
in order to learn what the debate was about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Getting into the
Lower House.</div>

<p>As the House of Commons is King, we
looked forward with eager interest to a visit
to that potent body. At the instance of our good friend,
Dr. Kerr, Sir James Campbell, a Presbyterian member of
the House from Scotland, wrote us an invitation to visit
the Commons in session, but, when we reached the door,
at the appointed hour, and sent in our cards through the
line of policemen and doorkeepers, there was no reply.
When we had waited some time, a gentleman in the crowd
at the entrance accosted us, and asked if we were not
Americans, and if we did not wish to get into the House,
both of which polite inquiries we answered with an
eager affirmative. He said he thought he could arrange
it for us, and, handing us his card, from which we
learned that he was the London correspondent of a great
American newspaper, he left us for a minute, and soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
returned, accompanied by a friend of his, one of the Irish
members of the House, to whom we were introduced, and
who promptly procured us permission to enter the visitors'
gallery. At Washington, any one who chooses can go
into the visitors' gallery, and listen to the debates, but
here there is a good deal of red tape. You must even
register your name and address, besides being introduced
by a member, before you can pass the turnstile and go in.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Debate and
the Debaters.</div>

<p>We soon discovered that we were very fortunate
in gaining admission just when we
did, as the greatest question of the whole year, and, indeed,
the greatest question that has been before the House
for many years, was up, viz., the Education Bill, the
object of which is to put the schools of England, for the
support of which the whole population is taxed, under
the control, not of the representatives of the public, but of
the ritualistic clergy of the Church of England; and in
the course of this very afternoon nearly every prominent
man in both of the great political parties was drawn into
the discussion. When we entered, Sir William Vernon
Harcourt, the veteran Liberal statesman, had the floor.
Among others who followed him on the same side of the
House were Mr. James Bryce, the well-known author of
<i>The Holy Roman Empire</i> and <i>The American Commonwealth</i>,
Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the leader of the
Liberal party in the House, and Mr. Lloyd George, who
has made the most active and brilliant opposition to this
treacherous, sectarian measure. The Irish Roman Catholics,
who, of course, have voted steadily and solidly with
the Anglican High Churchmen for this iniquitous bill,
which strikes at the root of the fundamental republican
principle of public control of public funds, were represented
in the debate by John Dillon. Of the others who
spoke in support of the bill, the two who interested me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
most were Lord Hugh Cecil, the special patron of the
measure, and his gifted cousin, Mr. Arthur J. Balfour,
the government leader of the House. The former, who,
I believe, is the son of the veteran Prime Minister, Lord
Salisbury, is a slender, pale, nervous young man, who
advocates very narrow views in very good language,
nervously pressing or wringing his slim fingers the while,
and who is the special champion of the ritualists and
reactionaries. Far more able and far more interesting in
every way is his accomplished kinsman, Mr. Balfour,
who, a few days later, was appointed Prime Minister.
He is a tall, ruddy, handsome Scotchman, with a rare
grace and charm of manner, and an exceptional air of
high breeding, who speaks in a manly, straightforward
way, with no trace of the bitterness, or even the heat so
common in political discussions. When one notes the
clearness of his mind, and the attractiveness of his address,
it gives a keener edge to the regret that such a man
should be on the wrong side of a great question like this.
Mr. Balfour is well known to the sporting world as a
golf player, and to the reading world as the author of a
thoughtful book on <i>The Foundations of Religious Belief</i>.</p>

<p>It will interest the readers of this paper to know that
he is a Presbyterian, as Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman,
the leader of the Opposition, also is. So that the leaders
of both the great parties in the House of Commons are
Scotchmen and Presbyterians.</p>

<p>One of the interesting consequences of Great Britain's
having a Presbyterian Prime Minister is, that under their
system of the union of church and state, a Presbyterian
will appoint the bishops and archbishops of the Church
of England to the vacancies of those offices which occur
during his premiership. This must be a very bitter pill
for the extreme High Churchmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">English and
American Oratory.</div>

<p>The failure of our arrangement with Sir
James Campbell turned out to be the result
of a misunderstanding, so he courteously renewed it
for the following day, when his friend and fellow-member,
Mr. Maxwell, who is also a Scotch Presbyterian, met us
at the door, in the absence of Sir James, and, after showing
us again everything of interest about the Houses,
including the restaurant, and the wide and spacious terrace,
running nearly the whole length of the building
alongside the Thames, where the members come, on fine
afternoons, to drink their tea, ushered us into seats "under
the gallery" of the House, which are regarded as the most
desirable for visitors, since there the spectator is on a
level with the speakers.</p>

<p>The Education Bill was still under discussion, and we
heard some good speaking, but not so good as I have
heard at Washington, and in the Constitutional Convention
at Richmond. The matter was generally good, but
the manner was in most cases constrained, if not hesitating,
and nearly all the members, including Mr. Balfour
himself, have a habit of grasping the lapels of their coats,
"taking themselves in hand," as some one has described it.
In short, the speaking itself lacks the ease, freedom,
fluency and force of our better American oratory.</p>

<p>However, it is only fair to give, before closing, the
estimate of a Canadian writer, who is familiar with both
London and Washington, and who says:</p>

<p>"The average of speaking is not so high in the House
of Commons as in Congress; but the level of the best
speakers is higher. American oratory almost always
savors somewhat of the school of elocution, and has the
fatal drawback of being felt to aim at effect. The greatest
of English speakers, such as John Bright, the greatest
of all, or Gladstone, create no such impression; you feel
that their only aim is to produce conviction."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the most striking things about the House of
Commons to the view of an American visitor is the well-groomed
appearance of the members. They are invariably
attired in faultless Prince Albert coats, often with
a boutonniere on the lapel, and they all wear silk hats,
which, by the way, they are not expected to take off
during the sittings, except when addressing the House.
It is said to be the best-dressed assembly in the world,
and is in sharp contrast with the more democratic and
unconventional, not to say slovenly, mode of dressing
which obtains in our House of Representatives, where the
ordinary costume is a long, loose frock coat&mdash;sometimes
even a sack&mdash;and a derby or felt hat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Two University
Towns.</div>

<p>Oxford, farther west, is a somewhat larger
city (about fifty-three thousand), with
twenty-three colleges and about three thousand students,
contains an unparalleled collection of picturesque academic
buildings, and has some single features which are
not surpassed anywhere, such as Magdalen (pronounced
Maudlen) College, "the loveliest of all the homes of learning,"
Addison's Walk, The Broad Walk, and the "streamlike
windings of that glorious street," to which Wordsworth
devoted a sonnet. But Cambridge, too, has some
features which cannot be paralleled, even in Oxford. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
instance, Cambridge has, in Trinity, the largest college
in England. It has, in the chapel of King's College, a
building of marvellous beauty; Oxford cannot match it,
nor can it be matched anywhere in England save by that
"miracle of the world," the Chapel of Henry VII., in
Westminster Abbey. The roll of Cambridge's alumni is
illustrious to a degree, having such names as Bacon, Erasmus,
Newton, Milton, Cromwell, Macaulay, Byron,
Thackeray, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Harvey (discoverer
of the circulation of the blood), Darwin, and many, many
others equally well known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cambridge
more Progressive
than
Oxford.</div>

<p>But the chief difference between Cambridge
and Oxford is in the spirit and influence of
the two upon the nation and the world, and
here the glory of Cambridge excelleth. It
used to be said in the fourteenth century, "What Oxford
thinks to-day, England thinks to-morrow." But, as a
matter of fact, it is Cambridge which has represented the
true progress of England and her modern political and
intellectual development, in such men as Milton and
Cromwell, Isaac Newton and William Pitt, Darwin and
Tennyson. Oxford has stood chiefly for the reactionary
ideas of the High Church Anglicans.</p>

<p>The difference was sharply marked in the great testing
time of the seventeenth century, when the East supported
the Parliament, and the West supported the king. London
and Cambridge were the centres of the Puritan
strength, Oxford was the capital of Charles I. Cromwell's
home was but a short distance from Cambridge,
and he was a student at Sidney-Sussex College, where we
had the pleasure of seeing his rooms, and the celebrated
crayon portrait of him in the college hall. Roughly, we
might say, Cambridge has stood for the Parliament and
the people, Oxford for the king and the priests. At least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
there has been more of the spirit of freedom, democracy
and progress at the eastern university town than at the
western.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Presbyterian
Element.</div>

<p>That the same difference still exists was indicated
to us by a simple fact. When we
inquired at Oxford for a Presbyterian church, the maid-servant
said, "That is Protestant, isn't it?" She was evidently
a Romanist, but it is likely that most of the Church
of England people resident in Oxford never heard of
Presbyterians, though our denomination is so much larger
than theirs. Oxford is the head centre of Anglicanism,
and there is no Presbyterian church there, though the
Congregationalists and Wesleyans are represented. But
at Cambridge we found a flourishing, though not yet a
very large, church of our faith and order, under the pastoral
care of a gifted and earnest man, the Rev. G. Johnston
Ross, whose addresses at the Winona Conference, in
Indiana, this summer, gave so much satisfaction. We had
the pleasure of meeting him, and many of his people, at
a pleasant garden party, to which all the Presbyterians of
Cambridge were invited.</p>

<p>By the way, we saw a thing in that church which we
had never seen before. When the minister read the Scripture
lesson from the Old Testament, in the English Version,
the two ladies in whose pew we were sitting opened
the Hebrew Bible, and followed the reading in that, and,
in like manner, when the New Testament lesson was read,
they followed in the Greek text. To these two ladies
whose learning has been recognized by the Universities
of St. Andrews and Heidelberg, in the bestowment upon
them of the degree of LL. D., and whose services to the
cause of biblical learning, in the discovery and editing of
the old Sinaitic Syriac manuscripts of the New Testament,
have made them famous throughout the world of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
scholars,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
we had a letter of introduction from a relative
of theirs in Virginia, who is a kind friend of ours. And
thus we had the pleasure of meeting at their table some
of the choice spirits of the University, including the
professors in Westminster College, which is the theological
seminary of the Presbyterian Church in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Westminster
College.</div>

<p>It was largely through the munificence of
Mrs. Lewis and Mrs. Gibson, the two elect
ladies referred to above, that this institution was transplanted
from its former undesirable location, and established
in the city of Cambridge, thus bringing the Puritan
theology back to its original home in England. The
financial agent who canvassed the English Presbyterian
Churches for the supplementing of the donation of these
two large-minded and large-hearted ladies was the Rev.
Dr. John Watson, of Liverpool, better known to the general
reader as "Ian Maclaren," author of <i>Beside the Bonnie
Brier Bush</i>, and other popular works; and for special
reasons it was with no ordinary interest that I examined
the result of his toils in the outfit with which the institution
has been provided. It is admirable. The location,
indeed, is not so good or so beautiful as that of Union
Seminary, in Richmond, with its breezy sweeps of green
campus, and the building, which is of red brick like ours,
is not nearly so imposing as the handsome group at Richmond.
Everything, in fact, is on a much smaller scale,
naturally so, as the English Presbyterian Church is a
much smaller body than our Southern Church. But, on
the other hand, there are some features that are superior,
<i>e. g.</i>, the stairways are of stone, not of wood as with us.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>The dining-hall is spacious, comely, cool, inviting, with
ornamental windows, and walls hung with portraits of
Presbyterian worthies, and the tables are heavy and handsome,
of hard wood. No seminary in our Southern
Church, or in the Northern, has a sufficiently attractive
refectory. The one at Union Seminary is better than
most of them, but it, too, is below the mark. Some benevolent
person can do a great work for our future ministry
by presenting that institution with a properly equipped
refectory building.</p>

<p>The rooms occupied by the students at Westminster
are much smaller than ours at Union, and seem in some
cases cramped, but there is a bath-room for every four
students. I fear this will seem almost a sinful degree of
cleanliness to those brethren who a few years ago were so
much opposed to the introduction of any bath-rooms and
other modern conveniences into our seminary.</p>

<p>There are three professors at Westminster College,
Cambridge: Principal Dykes, Dr. Gibb, and Professor
Skinner; and twenty-three students, a slightly smaller
number than last year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The same Difficulties
about Candidates.</div>

<p>The churches here are facing the same
problem that confronts those in America
as to an adequate supply of ministers. The number of candidates
is decreasing rapidly in Scotland. Some attribute
this decline to the stagnant spiritual condition of the
churches throughout Europe and America, and connect
it with the spread of devitalizing critical theories concerning
the Scriptures. But the zeal and activity of the
churches do not seem to be deficient in other particulars.
It is not a question to discuss here, but it is one for Christian
people to think about and pray over.</p>

<p>The identity of our difficulties in America and Britain
may be seen again in the fact that here also the theological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
schools are complaining that the universities are graduating
men with the degree of A. B. who have never
studied Greek. How can a man without Greek master
the New Testament in the original? Is it not clear that
no man can be a thoroughly furnished minister who has
not studied Greek? Yet some of our own colleges in
America, conducted under Presbyterian auspices, are encouraging
this crippling omission by offering an A. B.
course without Greek.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after leaving Newcastle-on-Tyne, the marked
change in the scenery of the country through which
we were passing apprised us of the fact that we had
crossed the border, and were now in Scotland.
Instead of the level or gently undulating
fields tilled like gardens, and the fine
oaks and other trees here and there, giving the country a
park-like aspect, there were bold hills on every hand,
intensely green, without a tree as far as the eye could
reach, and dotted only with white sheep. And, instead
of the tame rivers, winding lazily through wide meadows,
such as we had seen everywhere in England, there were
brawling brooks dashing down the ravines with an energy
that made them fit symbols of the strenuous activity of
the race whose land we were entering. Nothing in a
Scottish landscape is more striking to the American eye
than the uniform absence of trees on the hills and mountains.
There are some forest-clad mountains and ravines,
The Trossachs, for instance, as readers of Scott will
remember, but in most cases there are only grass, ferns,
and heather. This has the effect of throwing the shape of
the mountains into much sharper outline to the eye than
is the case with our American mountains, with their dense
forests.</p>

<p>If we had had the choosing of the conditions under
which we should enter Scotland, we would not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
changed them in any particular. The afternoon sun was
pouring golden light over the hills. The sky was as blue
as that of Italy, save occasional masses of snow-white
clouds towards the horizon&mdash;what one of our party calls
"Williams' shaving soap clouds"&mdash;and the air, with its
abundance of ozone, had an exhilarating and tonic effect
such as I have never known anywhere else in midsummer.</p>

greatest novelist that ever lived, the opportunity to visit

second time, and to drink in the exquisite beauty of the
Tweed Valley at this point, is one to be thankful for
indeed.</p>

  <div class="caption">SIR WALTER SCOTT'S SEAT IN MELROSE ABBEY.</div>
</div>

<p>Scott was a reactionary and a royalist, a Tory politically,
and a toady socially. He had an unreasoning reverence
for kings and courts. He never was in sympathy
with his countrymen in their long and bloody, but finally
successful, struggle against the tyranny of the church
and the state. In <i>Old Mortality</i>, and elsewhere, he slandered
the heroic Covenanters, who won the freedom of
Scotland. In <i>Woodstock</i> and elsewhere, he caricatured
Cromwell and the heroic Puritans, who won the freedom
of England. But, with all this, he never wrote anything
dirty or degrading, like so much of our latter day fiction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
He uniformly exalted bravery, and purity, and honor.
Nor should it ever be forgotten that towards the close
of his life, when he was overwhelmed by the disaster that
befell the publishing house with which he was connected,
and when he was thus plunged from independence and
affluence into poverty and debt, he gave the world a
splendid object lesson of personal honesty, by setting to
work, in his old age, to discharge his obligations by
continuous, laborious, exhausting work with his pen. He
succeeded, but the effort cost him his life. He has given
a larger amount of innocent and wholesome pleasure to
the reading world than any other writer that ever lived.
The unceasing stream of pilgrims to his home at Abbotsford
is but one of many indications of his unwaning popularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temporary

<p>Edinburgh at last! No. 4 Atholl Crescent.
It was delightful to settle down here, in our
rented apartments, after long toil at home
and long travel abroad, for a real rest, with just enough
walking and hill-climbing daily in and around the city to
give us a keen appetite for our meals. Round the bowl of
yellow Scotch earthenware, in which our oatmeal porridge
was served every morning, ran these lines from Burns:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"Some hae meat that canna eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1_5">And some wad eat that want it.</div>
    <div class="verse">But we hae meat an' we can eat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1_5">So let the Lord be thankit."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And, as our appetites sharpened more and more, with
the snell air of the German Ocean, and the abundant
exercise on the heath-clad hills, and the exemption from
wearing responsibilities, we entered more and more fully
into the sentiment.</p>

<p>By the way, the famous definition given by Dr. Samuel
Johnson, in his Dictionary, runs thus, "Oats: A grain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
which in England is generally given to horses, but in
Scotland supports the people." "Aye," said a Scotchman,
when he heard it, "and see what horses they have in
England, and what men we have in Scotland." Dr. Johnson,
who, by the way, owes his immortal fame to a Scotchman,
affected a dislike for Scotland, and said, among
other uncomplimentary things, that the only good road in
Scotland was the road that led to England.</p>

<p>Our feeling is exactly contrary to that, and we are so
charmed with what a good friend of mine calls "God's
country north of the Tweed," its wonderful beauty, its
matchless romance, its heroic history, the thronging memories
of its unsurpassed services to the causes of religion,
liberty, and letters, that we shall find it difficult to tear
ourselves away, and take the road to England at all.</p>

<p>But before undertaking to say anything of the vast
and fascinating themes just mentioned, let me set down,
in the remaining space of this letter, my impressions of
certain features of the present-day customs of the Scottish
people in their public worship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Public Worship
in Scotland.</div>

<p>In a number of particulars the church
usages among Presbyterians in England
and Scotland differ from ours in America. It is the universal
custom, when entering a pew at the beginning of
the service, to bow for a moment or so in silent prayer.
Likewise, at the close of the service, when the minister
pronounces the benediction upon the standing congregation,
all the people bow again in silent prayer before
leaving the church. They then rise, and withdraw in a
quieter and more reverential manner than is usual with
us. In America it is not infrequently the case that the
moment the minister says "Amen," at the close of the
benediction, the organist pulls out all the stops of his
instrument, sweeps the keyboard with might and main,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
and fills the building with a crashing tempest of sound,
apparently a very lively march, not to say a waltz, to the
jubilant strains of which the people move down the aisles,
while, instead of the subdued greetings that seem more
suitable to the sanctuary, they are straining their voices to
make themselves heard over the uproar of the music.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organ, Choir and
Congregation.</div>

<p>Even in Scotland, however, the custom of a
rather lively postlude from the organ as the
people are retiring is growing, as in Free St. Georges,
Edinburgh, which has the best organist I have heard in
Great Britain, Mr. Hollins. He is blind, but I have never
heard a man pour such melody from an organ, or lead a
singing congregation more judiciously and effectively
with an instrument. At times he leaves the organ quite
silent in the midst of the hymn, beating time with his
hand, and throwing out the voices of the people themselves.
The organ, as he uses it, is not a crutch for a lame
congregation to lean on, but a vaulting pole for an active
one to spring with. And the singing is magnificent.
Happy the church with two ministers such as Dr. Alexander
Whyte and the Rev. Hugh Black, and an organist
such as Mr. Hollins! Little wonder that the great building
is crowded to the doors at every service, and that if
one wishes to be sure of a seat he must come a half hour
before the time for the service to begin. This is quite easy
for us to do, as the apartments which we have occupied
for a month are but a few doors above the church. The
church music in Scotland is generally far superior to ours
in America. Solos and quartettes are almost unknown.
The choirs are large, and sit in front of the congregation,
just under the pulpit, and regard it as their business, not
so much to display their talents in rendering difficult
choir pieces as to lead the congregation in this important
part of the worship of God. And the people sing, generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
and heartily, rolling up to heaven a great volume
of praise. I am struck with the fact that the Scotch
Presbyterians have continued to use some of the most
majestic and uplifting of the ancient hymns, such as the
Te Deum, which we in America have in many places
ceased to use, substituting for these great hymns of the
ages the ephemeral jingles which make up too large a part
of our so-called "Gospel Hymns." There is more both
of dignity and variety of the right sort in the Scottish
church music, secured by the free use of close metrical
versions of the Psalms, paraphrases of other parts of
Scripture, and anthems of the best type&mdash;all sung, mark
you, by the whole congregation, and not by the choir
only.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bibles in
The Churches.</div>

<p>There is another thing about the Scotch
churches that I would like to see introduced
into every church in America, and that is the use of the
Bible by the people. A book-board is affixed to the back
of every pew, running the whole length of it, and on this
are laid a sufficient number of hymn-books and Bibles for
all the people in the pew behind. When the preacher is
about to read his Scripture lesson (there are always two
at the morning service, one from the Old Testament, and
one from the New), he announces the book and chapter,
then pauses a minute while the people turn to the place,
and, as he reads, they follow. So, too, when he announces
his text. It is an excellent custom. It would be difficult
to overstate the value of it. It is not unconnected with
the fact that the Scotch people, as a whole, know more
about the Bible than any other people in the world.</p>

<p>The International System of Sunday-school Lessons
has done more to promote knowledge of the Bible than
any other system ever generally used since the modern
Sunday-school came into existence, notwithstanding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
sweeping and indiscriminating strictures made upon it by
some good brethren of late. But that system is certainly
capable of improvement. One of the unfortunate results
charged to the use of the lesson sheets of the International
series is the neglect of the Bible itself. The children, it is
said, do not bring their Bibles with them, and do not
become familiar with them, as a whole, in the Sunday-school.
It is too true in many cases. But are not their
seniors equally indifferent about having Bibles in the
regular service? How can ministers expect to bring
about the desired revival of expository preaching unless
they can get Bibles into the hands of the people during
the service? Suppose that, like the Scotch, we had an
adequate supply of Bibles as a regular part of the equipment
of our churches and Sunday-schools, would not this
difficulty about the neglect of the Bible, which so many
charge to the use of the lesson leaves, be effectually met?
Why should there not be at least as good a supply of
Bibles in a church as of hymn-books? Never were Bibles
so cheap as now.</p>

<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <i>August 25, 1902</i>.
</p>


<div class="sidenote">London
Preachers.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I once</span> received a letter from the late Rev. Dr.
William S. Lacy, saying that he had been trying to
make use of a certain work in one of the departments of
theological study, and asking if I could suggest something
"less fearfully jejune," an expression
which I have ever since regarded as a masterpiece
of characterization. The first sermon I heard in
Europe, preached in a cathedral, in 1896, by a clergyman
of the English Church, reminded me of it, for it gave me
an intense craving for something "less fearfully jejune."
One of my ministerial companions remarked that it was
about such a discourse as one would expect from a member
of the junior class in Union Seminary, which I
thought was rather hard on the juniors. The other five
sermons that I heard from ministers of the Church of
England that year, preached respectively by Canon Holland,
Dean Farrar, Dr. Wace, Rev. H. R. Haweis, and
Mr. Gray, of Heidelberg, were certainly not jejune, whatever
else may be said of them. At Heidelberg we had
the good fortune to meet Prof. Gildersleeve, of Baltimore,
who is quite at home in the German university towns, and
who was very kind to us in every way. He took us to the
English Church there. Mr. Gray is a quiet, thoughtful,
and edifying preacher&mdash;the right kind of man, I should
say, for a community of that sort. Canon Holland&mdash;a
man of far more freshness and vigor&mdash;preached in St.
Paul's, and, though powerfully built, and with a resonant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
and well-managed voice, could be heard by only a small
portion of the large congregation. It is said that the late
Canon Liddon, the foremost preacher of the English
Church in his time, broke himself down prematurely by
the extraordinary exertions he made to project his voice to
the limits of the great crowds which gathered in that vast
building to hear him. I have an eccentric friend in New
England who calls the cathedrals "Gothic devils," because
they hinder the preaching of the gospel. St. Paul's is
not Gothic, of course, but it is worse, perhaps, in point of
acoustics than any Gothic church whatsoever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dean Farrar.</div>

<p>We had the singular good fortune, in 1896,
to hear Dean Farrar one evening in Westminster
Abbey in a discourse which displayed, to the best
possible advantage, the exceeding opulence of his rhetoric.
He was trying to raise money for the restoration of Canterbury
Cathedral in a manner worthy of its approaching
thirteen hundredth anniversary, and his discourse was a
review of the work of the English Church and the English
nation during these thirteen centuries. What a combination
of man and subject and place that was! The
most rhetorical eminent preacher of the day, discussing
with all the exuberance of his splendid diction such a subject
as "England," ecclesiastical and civil, for the last
thirteen hundred years, in such a place as Westminster
Abbey, surrounded by the tombs and statues of England's
mighty dead, the wearers of her crown, and the possessors
of her genius, her soldiers, and sailors, and statesmen,
her painters, and poets, and philosophers, and preachers&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"Those dead but sceptered sovereigns</div>
    <div class="verse">Whose spirits still rule us from their urns."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The rich music, the soft light, the dim arches, the
white statues, the stirring theme, the sympathetic voice,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
the luxuriant rhetoric&mdash;as the preacher referred, for instance,
to "the sea which England has turned from an
estranging barrier into an azure marriage ring for the
union of the nations"&mdash;all conspired to make a unique
impression. Dean Farrar's ornate style cloys on the taste
sometimes when one reads his books, but when listening
to his sermons it was not so. He was a very effective
preacher, and, in the notable discourse to which I have
just referred, he did not once overlay his thought too
thickly with glittering verbiage. As for the other parts
of the service I have only to say again that it is an unspeakable
pity that a noble service like that of the Church
of England (in which, as to its essence, all evangelical
people can heartily unite) should be so commonly made a
mere matter of mechanical routine, and artificial and
absurd recitation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Haweis and
Dr. Wace.</div>

<p>Mr. Haweis looked like a small edition of
the late Henry Ward Beecher&mdash;long hair,
smooth face, large mouth, but with a peculiar, penetrating
voice, and an abrupt, jerky manner. He was unconventional
and racy to the last degree, and cut a good many
"monkey shines" in the pulpit, which were all the more
startling because of his elaborate white clerical vestments&mdash;such
as resting his elbow on the desk, with his chin in
his hand, for the space of five minutes, talking all the time
as fast as Phillips Brooks, except for the peculiar "ah!
ah!" which he interjected between sentences from time to
time, as if unable to find the word he wanted&mdash;then letting
himself down, and hanging over the pulpit on his armpits,
with his arms in front and his body behind. His
sermon didn't have anything to do with his text, so far as
I could see. He was a Broad Churchman, as broad as
Dean Stanley. In fact, he was like the dog of which the
train man said, in answer to an inquiry as to the dog's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
destination, "I don't know, an' 'ee don't know, an' nobody
don't know. 'Ee's et his tag."</p>

<p>Dr. Wace, in whom I was interested as one of the
stoutest knights who have recently measured lances with
the agnostics, preached a well written sermon, in a dull
and lifeless way, to a handful of people at Lincoln's Inn
Chapel. But we should not forget that there are many
Presbyterian ministers who, as one of our secretaries of
foreign missions once said, "carry a load of dogmatic
theology into the pulpit, and dump it on the people, laboring
all the time under the delusion that in so doing they
are preaching the gospel."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spurgeon, Parker
and Hughes.</div>

<p>Some years ago a child was asked, "Who
is the Prime Minister of England?" and
replied, not unnaturally, "Mr. Spurgeon." That Spurgeon
has been called up still higher, but in the great Metropolitan
Tabernacle, which he built in London, thousands of
people still gather Sunday after Sunday to hear the gospel
preached by his son and successor, the Rev. Thomas
Spurgeon. Of course, he cannot bend the bow of Ulysses.
But, for that matter, there is no preacher living who can.
Still he is a clear, earnest, effective preacher. We were
at the opposite end of the church from him, but heard
every word distinctly.</p>

<p>Another dissenting minister, who continues to draw
great crowds in London, is Dr. Joseph Parker, and he is
probably the ablest preacher in the city, though on the
day I first heard him, in 1896, he was so indistinct in his
utterances at times that I found it almost impossible to
follow him. There was an air of self-importance about
him which I trust was only apparent. We heard him
again the other day, when he occupied his pulpit for the
first time after a long illness. He was quite feeble, and
there were only occasional brief flashes of the volcanic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
fires which used to flame and thunder through his
preaching.</p>

<p>I heard the Rev. Hugh Price Hughes also, the leading
Methodist preacher of London, in a faithful and striking
exposition of Haggai, an excellent expository sermon, just
what I did not expect from him, as he has at times been
charged with sensationalism.</p>

<p>The Moravians, as is well known, lead the whole
Christian world in zeal and liberality in the cause of
Foreign Missions. At the Moravian chapel in Fetter
Lane we heard a clear and helpful sermon from Mr.
Waugh, the minister in charge. After the service he
kindly showed us all through the Mission House, the
centre of that unique propaganda which, with comparatively
small resources, has given the pure gospel to so
many remote and needy portions of the globe, and set
the pace for all the churches in the work of carrying out
the Great Commission. This chapel has some associations
with John Wesley; and, remembering the obligations
under which he lay to these earnest, evangelical
Christians of the Unitas Fratrum, and the part since
played by the great Methodist Church in the evangelization
of the world, we felt that the Moravian Mission
House was an appropriate place in which to recall the
character and services of that rightly venerated epoch-maker
and man of God who said, "My parish is the
world."</p>

<p>I heard a number of rich sermons from Dr. John
Hunter, Gipsy Smith, Dr. Thornton, Rev. R. J. Campbell,
and Mr. Connell. But the strongest, most spiritual and
most comforting sermon I heard in London was preached
by the Rev. J. Monro Gibson, D. D., pastor of St. John's
Wood Presbyterian Church. That also was an expository
sermon, as the best preaching so often is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">General Booth.</div>

<p>The only other man of mark whom I heard
in the metropolis was General Booth, organizer,
leader, and absolute monarch of the Salvation Army,
an old man of spare frame, with shaggy, grisled hair and
beard. His voice is not a good one, but he commands
perfect attention, and his sermon, which was evidently
well thought out, and which, if I remember aright, had but
one undignified remark in it, showed the true nature of
sin, and laid hold of the conscience with power. When
we entered Exeter Hall, which was already nearly full of
people, we saw on the platform a band of sixty musicians,
in scarlet uniforms, leading the multitude with violins,
cornets and drums, in a hymn sung lustily to the tune of
"Auld Lang Syne." When the General came on the platform
a few minutes later, they received him with a cheer.
His sermon was followed by the usual uproarious proceedings.
With these, of course, I have no sympathy, nor
with the absolute despotism of General Booth, but the
Salvation Army has done a vast deal of good among "the
submerged tenth." The census taken this year by the
<i>London News</i> shows, however, that the Salvation Army
is on the decline in that city, and the reason assigned for
it is the lack of a body of trained preachers.</p>

<p>But Scotland is the land of preachers. The greatest
Scotchman that ever lived was a preacher, and to him,
John Knox, Scotland is more indebted for what she is
to-day than to any other man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Sir
Walter Said.</div>

<p>"The Scotch, it is well known, are more
remarkable for the exercise of their intellectual
powers than for the keenness of their feelings; they
are, therefore, more moved by logic than by rhetoric, and
more attracted by acute and argumentative reasoning on
doctrinal points than influenced by the enthusiastic appeals
to the heart and to the passions, by which the popular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
preachers in other countries win the favor of their
hearers." So wrote Sir Walter Scott, and no doubt there
is truth in it; but we must not underestimate the quickness
and depth of their feelings. It was an apparently
hard-natured Scotchman of our own day who wrote the
following more balanced estimate, "It's a God's mercy I
was born a Scotchman, for I do not see how I could ever
have been contented to be anything else. The little,
plucky, dour nation, set in her own ways, and getting
them, too, level-headed and shrewd, and yet so lovingly
weak, so fond, so led away by song or story, so easily
touched to fine issues, so real, so true." Carlyle said
Burns was the æolian harp of nature against which the
rude winds of adversity blew, only to be transmuted in
their passage into heavenly music. But no people without
tender and strong feelings could have produced or appreciated
such a poet as Burns. (By the way, I was
astonished to discover, in 1896, that there were more
than thirty thousand visitors annually to the birthplace of
Burns, as against only twenty thousand to the birthplace
of Shakespeare.) Moreover, no people without the right
kind of feeling, and plenty of it&mdash;aye, and of enthusiasm,
too&mdash;could have accomplished what Scotland has done.
With a rigorous climate and a small country, much of it
wild and untillable mountain and moor, and with fewer
people in the whole country than in the city of London,
Scotland&mdash;</p>

<p>and to-day she wields an influence in the world out of all

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Marcus Dods.</div>

<p>But I have wandered from my subject,
which was Scotch preaching and preachers.
I heard four eminent men in Edinburgh, on my first visit
there six years ago&mdash;Prof. A. B. Davidson, Prof. Marcus
Dods, Dr. Alexander Whyte, and Dr. George Matheson.
Prof. Davidson's voice, manner and style were much
better adapted to a small class-room, with its detailed
linguistic and exegetical methods, than to popular preaching
in a large church. But if there was some disappointment
in regard to the preaching of the learned and famous
author of the Hebrew grammars, and the father of the
whole liberal, not to say radical, movement in Biblical
Criticism, which has swept all Scotland into its vortex,
there was none in regard to that of his brilliant colleague,
Dr. Dods. Many of my readers are familiar with the late
Dr. Henry C. Alexander's high estimate of Dr. Dods'
work on New Testament Introduction, which he used as a
textbook in Union Seminary, and with the general excellence
of his luminous and suggestive commentaries,
though some of them are unfortunately marred by the
obtrusion of views which are not altogether satisfactory.
But probably few readers, even of his best books, would
have expected from him a sermon so sane, and sound, and
spiritual as that which I heard from him. It was fully
written, and very quietly read, with absolutely no action,
and with a modest and even diffident manner, but before
he had uttered half a dozen sentences, the originality and
power of the thought, and the freshness and vigor of the
language, laid the hearer under the spell of a master, and,
as he proceeded, first with keen analysis and irrefutable
argument, and then with those considerations which can
never be adduced save by a man who has had <i>experience</i>,
who knows sin, and struggle, and salvation, your sense of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the preacher's power was succeeded, or rather accompanied,
by a sense of his sympathy, and you were ready
to accompany him to his high practical conclusion, and
left the church assured that he had, under God, given you
a real and abiding spiritual uplift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. George
Matheson.</div>

<p>The only other man who impressed me
deeply, on my former visit to Edinburgh,
was Dr. Matheson. He is antipodal to Prof. Dods in his
style of preaching. He is blind, as you know, and was
led in from the vestry to the pulpit, a large man, with
gray hair and beard, and a ruddy and radiant face, despite
his sightless eyes, as though he walked continually
in the white vision of the Invisible. His short, fervent,
pointed prayers seemed to put every earnest hearer into
sensible communion with the Father of our spirits, and
his sermon on the great disappointments and mysteries
of life was most satisfying and comforting, and was delivered
with rare animation and unction, the rich fancy
and glowing language justifying the remark made to me
afterwards by an eminent Scotchman, that Matheson was
a poet as well as a preacher. I must add that some of my
friends who went to hear him afterwards, on the ground
of my enthusiastic recommendation, were disappointed,
saying that his exegesis was illegitimate, and that he
treated his text after the manner of Origen and the Allegorizers.
But we must remember that even Spurgeon
was often guilty of that. This does not excuse it, of
course. It only shows that a man may sometimes do it,
and yet be a great preacher.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Whyte and
Mr. Black.</div>

<p>Dr. Whyte, of Free St. George's, is reckoned
by many the ablest preacher in Edinburgh.
I was in his church on my former visit to Scotland,
when he preached a deeply moving sermon in connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
with a communion service. Unfortunately for us,
he was absent from the city during the whole of our stay
this time. But his brilliant young associate, the Rev.
Hugh Black, leaves one no ground for complaint as to the
quality of the preaching in Edinburgh in the summer.
He is a very highly cultivated man, and an original and
suggestive preacher, but with no special advantages of
manner. He is slender, pallid, nervous, with a rather
pleasing voice in its lower tones, but of limited range,
breaking if he attempts to raise it. This shuts him out
from some of the best oratorical effects. But what he
lacks in voice and manner he makes up in richness of
matter, and finish of style. He is well known as the
author of <i>Friendship</i> and <i>Culture and Restraint</i>, two
books which have had a wide circulation in America.
We have made his church our regular place of worship,
and have been drawn away from it only occasionally by
the desire to hear such well-known veterans as Dr. McGregor,
of St. Cuthbert's Established Church, and Dr.
Hood Wilson, the retiring pastor of Barclay Free Church.
This last, by the way, is a curious, but rather striking
stone building, with the most hideous interior I have ever
seen. It is a night-mare of bad taste.</p>

<p>We have heard at other times Prof. Orr, author of
various works of value in the department of Dogmatic
Theology, the Rev. P. Carnegie Simpson, of Glasgow,
author of <i>The Fact of Christ</i>, and the Rev. Thomas
Burns, F. R. S. E., author of a unique and sumptuous
work on <i>Old Scottish Communion Plate</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Inevitable
Subject.</div>

<p>To Mr. Burns I am indebted for an introduction
to Prof. Sayce, of Oxford, and for
a delightful hour at tea with the famous archæologist and
author in his house at Edinburgh, where he spends most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of the summer. He generally lives on a houseboat on the
Nile in winter, and the weather in Edinburgh this summer
has been such as to make him long for that houseboat,
and that soft Egyptian climate more than ever.
When we reached the city a month ago, we found much
the same kind of weather that greeted Mary Queen of
Scots on her return from France, and of which John
Knox wrote as follows, "The very face of heaven did
manifestlie speak what comfort was brought to this country
with hir&mdash;to wit, sorrow, dolour, darkness and all
impiety&mdash;for in the memorie of man never was seen
more dolorous face of the heavens than was at her arryvall
... the myst was so thick that skairse micht onie
man espy another; and the sun was not seyn to shyne
two days befoir nor two days after." We had mists a
plenty, but it was the cold weather and the rain that interfered
most with our plans. It actually did rain nearly
every day, and often four or five times a day, not mere
showers, but drenching rains. In fact, the kind of
weather we had nearly all the time, not only in Edinburgh,
but throughout Scotland and England, gave us a keen
appreciation of the following story of the London weather
which we find in the Manchester <i>Guardian</i>:</p>

<p>"The scene was a Strand omnibus. A leaden sky was
overhead, the rain poured down uncompromisingly, mud
was underfoot. A red-capped Parsee, who had been sitting
near the dripping driver, got down as the conductor
came up. 'What sort o' chap is that,' asked the driver.
'Don't yer know that,' answered the conductor. 'Why,
that's one o' them Indians that worship the sun!' 'Worships
the sun?' said the shivering driver. 'I suppose
'e's come over 'ere to 'ave a rest!'</p>

<p>"This recalls the reply given on one occasion by an
Eastern potentate to Queen Victoria, who asked him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
whether his people did not worship the sun. 'Yes, your
Majesty,' said the Oriental, 'and if you saw him you
would worship him also.'"</p>

<p>However, if I begin to write about Scotch weather, I
shall never get back to my proper subject, which is Scotch
preaching.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> mention of St. Cuthbert's, where we heard an
excellent coronation sermon by Dr. McGregor, reminds
me of the prayer offered in St. Cuthbert's by the
Rev. Neill McVicar, in 1745, just after the Young Pretender
had won the battle of Prestonpans.
A message was sent to the Edinburgh ministers,
in the name of "Charles Prince Regent," desiring
them to open their churches next day as usual. McVicar
preached to a large congregation, many of whom were
armed Highlanders, and prayed for George II., the reigning
monarch, and also for Charles Edward, the Young
Pretender, in the following terms, "Bless the king! Thou
knowest what king I mean. May the crown sit long upon
his head! As for that young man who has come among
us to seek an earthly crown, we beseech thee to take him
to thyself, and give him a crown of glory!"</p>

<p>One of our pleasant excursions, of which we have
made many since coming to Edinburgh, was to the field
of Prestonpans, where the Young Pretender won his delusive
victory, a field made familiar to many by the vivid
description in <i>Waverley</i>. An aged tree, now supported
and braced by iron rods and wires, is pointed out as that
under which the Pretender stood during part of the engagement.
Under this tree, in the tall wheat, overlooking
the peaceful fields and the shining sea, our photographers
insisted that a picture should be taken of some of the
party, weary and dusty, and I fear untidy as we were.

Half a mile away, and within a few feet of the railway,
stands the monument to Col. Gardiner, who was killed in
this battle, and of whom Scott gives such a striking
account in the first of his immortal romances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Church-going
in Edinburgh.</div>

<p>But there I go again, instead of finishing
the subject of church services. In Kate
Douglas Wiggin's sparkling volume, entitled <i>Penelope's
Progress</i>, there is an amusing description of the perplexity
of a young woman from America, on noticing from her
window the great crowds of people on the streets of Edinburgh
on Sunday morning, her speculations as to the
cause&mdash;"Do you suppose it is a fire?"&mdash;and her amazement
at discovering that they were all going to church.
And truly the Scotch people are great church-goers. Nothing
like it is ever seen on our side of the ocean, except
in the predominantly Scotch cities of Canada.</p>

<p>"I have never seen such attention, such concentration,
as in these great congregations of the Edinburgh
churches. As nearly as I can judge, it is intellectual
rather than emotional; but it is not a tribute paid to
eloquence alone, it is habitual and universal, and is
yielded loyally to insufferable dullness when occasion
demands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bibles.</div>

<p>"When the text is announced, there is an
indescribable rhythmic movement forward,
followed by a concerted rustle of Bible leaves; not the
rustle of a few Bibles in a few pious pews, but the rustle
of all of them in all the pews&mdash;and there are more Bibles
in an Edinburgh Presbyterian Church than one ever sees
anywhere else, unless it be in the warehouses of the Bible
Societies.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i088.jpg" id="i088.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i088.jpg" width="600" height="421"
      alt="" />
  <div class="caption">DRILL OF HIGHLANDERS, EDINBURGH CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>"The text is read twice clearly, and another rhythmical
movement follows, when the books are replaced on the
shelves. Then there is a delightful settling back of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
entire congregation, a snuggling comfortably into corners,
and a fitting of shoulders to the pews&mdash;not to sleep, however;
an older generation may have done that under the
strain of a two-hour 'wearifu' dreich' sermon, but these
church-goers are not to be caught napping. They wear,
on the contrary, a keen, expectant, critical look, which
must be inexpressibly encouraging to the minister, if he
has anything to say. If he has not (and this is a possibility
in Edinburgh, as it is everywhere else), then I am
sure it is wisdom for the beadle to lock him in (the
pulpit) lest he flee when he meets those searching eyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sermon.</div>

<p>"The Edinburgh sermon, though doubtless
softened in outline in these later years, is
still a more carefully built discourse than one ordinarily
hears outside of Scotland, being constructed on conventional
lines of doctrine, exposition, logical inference, and
practical application. Though modern preachers do not
announce the division of their subject into heads and subheads,
firstlies and secondlies and finallies my brethren,
there seems to be the old framework underneath the sermon,
and every one recognizes it as moving silently below
the surface; at least, I always fancy that as the minister
finishes one point and attacks another the younger folk
fix their eagle eyes on him afresh, and the whole congregation
sits up straighter and listens more intently, as if
making mental notes. They do not listen so much as if
they were enthralled, though they often are, and have
good reason to be, but as if they were to pass an examination
on the subject afterwards; and I have no doubt
that this is the fact.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Prayers.</div>

<p>"The prayers are many, and are divided, apparently,
like those of the liturgies, into
petitions, confessions, and aspirations, not forgetting the
all-embracing one with which we are perfectly familiar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in our native land, in which the preacher commends to
the Fatherly care every animate and inanimate thing not
mentioned specifically in the foregoing supplications. It
was in the middle of this compendious petition, 'the lang
prayer,' that rheumatic old Scotch dames used to make a
practice of 'cheengin' the fit,' as they stood devoutly
through it. 'When the meenister comes to the "ingatherin'
o' the Gentiles," I ken weel it's time to change legs,
for then the prayer is jist half dune,' said a good sermon-taster
of Fife.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Music.</div>

<p>"The organ is finding its way rapidly into
the Scottish kirks (how can the shade of
John Knox endure a 'kist o' whistles' in good St. Giles?),
but it is not used yet in some of those we attend most frequently.
There is a certain quaint solemnity, a beautiful
austerity, in the unaccompanied singing of hymns, that
touches me profoundly. I am often carried very high on
the waves of splendid church music, when the organ's
thunder rolls 'through vaulted aisles,' and the angelic
voices of a trained choir chant the aspirations of my soul
for me; but when an Edinburgh congregation stands, and
the precentor leads in that noble paraphrase&mdash;</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p>there is a certain ascetic fervor in it that seems to me the
perfection of worship. It may be that my Puritan ancestors
are mainly responsible for this feeling, or perhaps
my recently adopted Jenny Geddes is a factor in it; of
course, if she were in the habit of flinging fauldstules at
Deans, she was probably the friend of truth and the foe
of beauty, so far as it was in her power to separate them."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Jenny Geddes

in St. Giles, where that redoubtable assailant of "the
papists and their apists" hurled her memorable missile.
I trust the story is well known to many of my readers,
especially our young people, but perhaps all are not
familiar with the extremely racy version of it written by
the late Professor Stuart Blackie, one of the most brilliant
and versatile men of the age, and given to me by a
kinswoman of his, whose charming hospitality I once had
the privilege of enjoying for two weeks; so I will embody
that version of it in my letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Disruption
in 1843.</div>

<p>Of course, too, we visited St. Andrew's
Church, in the newer part of the city, on the
other side of the great, picturesque ravine which divides
the old town from the new, because it was the scene of
another epoch-making event in the ecclesiastical history
of Scotland, viz., the Disruption of 1843. Unable to
abolish the patronage of livings, by which certain heritors
or patrons could appoint any minister they wished to a
vacant pastorate, without the consent of the congregation,
Dr. Chalmers and his party decided to take a very bold
step in order to preserve the freedom of the church. When
the Assembly met in St. Andrew's Church, in the presence
of a great body of spectators, while a vast throng
outside awaited the result with almost breathless interest,
though not really believing that any large number of the
ministers would relinquish their homes and salaries for the
sake of a "fantastic principle," all expectations were surpassed
when the Moderator, after reading a formal protest
signed by one hundred and twenty ministers and
seventy-two elders, left his place, and was followed first
by Dr. Chalmers, and then by four hundred and seventy
men, who marched in a body to Tanfield Hall, and there
organized the General Assembly of the Free Church of
Scotland. When Lord Jeffrey was told of it an hour
later, he exclaimed, "Thank God for Scotland! There is
not another country on earth where such a deed could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
done!" Well might the Scottish minister remind his
American visitor of Lord Macaulay's remark that the
Scots had made sacrifices for the sake of religious opinion
for which there was no parallel in the annals of England.
Many of my readers are familiar with the exceedingly
impressive appearance of this Disruption Assembly, from
the well-known engraving, a copy of which hangs in the
Reading Room of the Spence Library, at Union Theological
Seminary, Richmond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Sermon-taster
with a Nippy
Tongue.</div>

<p>It would never do, when speaking of church
matters in Edinburgh, to omit Penelope's
account of her landlady's breezy comments
on the different preachers.</p>

<p>"It is to Mrs. McCollop that we owe our chief insight
into technical church matters, although we seldom agree
with her 'opeenions' after we gain our own experience.
She never misses hearing one sermon on a Sabbath, and
oftener she listens to two or three. Neither does she
confine herself to the ministrations of a single preacher,
but roves from one sanctuary to another, seeking the
bread of life, often, however, according to her own account,
getting a particularly indigestible 'stane.'</p>

<p>"She is thus a complete guide to the Edinburgh pulpit,
and when she is making a bed in the morning she dispenses
criticism in so large and impartial a manner that it
would make the flesh of the 'meenistry' creep were it
overheard. I used to think Ian Maclaren's sermon-taster
a possible exaggeration of an existent type, but I now see
that she is truth itself.</p>

<p>"'Ye'll be tryin' anither kirk the morn?' suggested
Mrs. McCollop, spreading the clean Sunday sheet over the
mattress. 'Wha did he hear the Sawbath that's bye? Dr.
A.? Ay, I ken him ower weel; he's been there for fifteen
years and mair. Ay, he's a gifted mon&mdash;<i>off an' on!'</i> with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
an emphasis showing clearly that in her estimation the
times when he is 'off' outnumber those when he is 'on.'...
'Ye have na heard auld Dr. B. yet?' (Here she
tucks in the upper sheet tidily at the foot.) 'He's a
graund strachtforrit mon, is Dr. B., forbye he's growin'
maist awfu' dreich in his sermons, though when he's that
wearisome a body canna heed him withoot takin' peppermints
to the kirk, he's nane the less, at seventy-sax, a
better mon than the new asseestant. Div ye ken the new
asseestant? He's a wee bit finger-fed mannie, ower sma'
maist to wear a goon! I canna thole him, wi' his lang-nebbit
words, explainin' and expoundin' the gude Book
as if it had jist come oot! The auld doctor's nae kirk-filler,
but he gi'es us fu' measure, pressed down an' rinnin'
over, nae bit pickin's like the haverin' asseestant; it's
my opeenion he's no sound, wi' his parleyvoos and his
clishmaclavers!... Mr. C.?' (Now comes the shaking
and straightening and smoothing of the first blanket.)
'Ay, he's weel eneuch! I mind ance he prayed for our
Free Assembly, an' then he turned roun' an' prayed for
the Established, maist in the same breath&mdash;he's a broad,
leeberal mon, is Mr. C.!... Mr. D.? Ay, I ken him
fine; he micht be waur, though he's ower fond o' the kittle
pairts o' the Old Testament; but he reads his sermon
from the paper, an' it's an auld sayin', If a meenister
canna mind [remember] his ain discoors, nae mair can
the congregation be expectit to mind it.... Mr. E.?
He's my ain meenister.' (She has a pillow in her mouth
now, but though she is shaking it as a terrier would a
rat, and drawing on the linen slip at the same time, she
is still intelligible between the jerks.) 'Susanna says his
sermon is like claith made o' soond 'oo [wool] wi' a' gude
twined thread, an' wairpit an' weftit wi' doctrine. Susanna
kens her Bible weel, but she's never gaed forrit.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
(To 'gang forrit' is to take the communion.) 'Dr. F.?
I ca' him the greetin' doctor. He's aye dingin' the dust
oot o' the poopit cushions, an' greetin' ower the sins o'
the human race, an' eespecial'y of his ain congregation.
He's waur syne his last wife sickened an' slippit awa'.
'T was a chastenin' he'd put up wi' twice afore, but he
grat nane the less. She was a bonnie bit body, was the
third Mistress F.! E'nbro could 'a' better spared the
greetin' doctor than her, I'm thinkin'.</p>

<p>'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away according
to his good will and pleasure,' I ventured piously,
as Mrs. McCollop beat the bolster and laid it in place.</p>

<p>'Ou ay,' responded that good woman, as she spread
the counterpane over the pillows in the way I particularly
dislike; 'ou ay, but whiles I think it's a peety he
couldna be guidit!'"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scottish and

Repartee.</div>

<p>Finally, I cannot refrain from quoting
Francesca's account of the peppery conversation
she had with the young Scottish minister
with whom she was destined to fall in love. She
returned from the dinner, at which she had met him, all
out of sorts:</p>

<p>"How did you get on with your delightful minister?"
inquired Salemina.... "He was quite the handsomest
man in the room; who is he?"</p>

<p>"He is the Reverend Ronald Macdonald, and the most
disagreeable, condescending, ill-tempered prig I ever
met!"</p>

<p>"Why, Francesca!" I exclaimed. "Lady Baird speaks
of him as her favorite nephew, and says he is full of
charm."</p>

<p>"He is just as full of charm as he was when I met
him," returned the girl nonchalantly; "that is, he parted
with none of it this evening. He was incorrigibly stiff
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and rude, and oh! so Scotch! I believe if one punctured
him with a hat pin, oatmeal would fly into the air!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless you acquainted him, early in the evening,
with the immeasurable advantages of our sleeping-car
system, the superiority of our fast-running elevators, and
the height of our buildings?" observed Salemina.</p>

<p>"I mentioned them," Francesca answered evasively.</p>

<p>"You naturally inveighed against the Scotch climate?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I alluded to it; but only when he had said that
our hot summers must be insufferable."</p>

<p>"I suppose you repeated the remark you made at
luncheon, that the ladies you had seen in Princes Street
were excessively plain?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," she replied hotly; "but that was because
he said that American girls generally looked bloodless and
frail. He asked if it were really true that they ate chalk
and slate pencils. Was'n't that unendurable? I answered
that those were the chief solid articles of food, but that
after their complexions were established, so to speak, their
parents often allowed them pickles and native claret to
vary the diet."</p>

<p>"What did he say to that?" I asked.</p>

<p>"'Oh!' he said, 'quite so, quite so'; that was his invariable
response to all my witticisms. Then, when I
told him casually that the shops looked very small and
dark and stuffy here, and that there were not as many
tartans and plaids in the windows as we had expected, he
remarked, that as to the latter point, the American season
had not opened yet! Presently, he asserted that no royal
city in Europe could boast ten centuries of such glorious
and stirring history as Edinburgh. I said it did not appear
to be stirring much at present, and that everything
in Scotland seemed a little slow to an American; that he
could have no idea of push or enterprise until he visited a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
city like Chicago. He retorted that, happily, Edinburgh
was peculiarly free from the taint of the ledger and the
counting-house; that it was Weimar without a Goethe,
Boston without its twang!"</p>

<p>"Incredible!" cried Salemina, deeply wounded in her
local pride. "He never could have said 'twang' unless
you had tried him beyond measure!"</p>

<p>"I dare say I did; he is easily tried," returned Francesca.
"I asked him, sarcastically, if he had ever been in
Boston. 'No,' he said, 'it is not necessary to go there!
And while we are discussing these matters,' he went on,
'how is your American dyspepsia these days&mdash;have you
decided what is the cause of it?'"</p>

<p>"'Yes, we have,' said I, as quick as a flash; 'we have
always taken in more foreigners than we could assimilate!'
I wanted to tell him that one Scotsman of his type
would upset the national digestion anywhere, but I restrained
myself."</p>

<p>"I am glad you did restrain yourself&mdash;once," exclaimed
Salemina.</p>

<p>And so on, with Francesca's characterization of the
Forth Bridge as the national idol, her inability to tell
which way to turn a drawing of it so as to make the bridge
right side up, his asking her if doughnuts resembled peanuts,
and his telling her he had heard that the ministers'
salaries in America were sometimes paid in pork and
potatoes, his comments on international marriages, and
her conclusion, as she retired that night, "I doubt if I
can sleep for thinking what a pity it is that such an egotistic,
bumptious, pugnacious, prejudiced, insular, bigoted
person should be so handsome!"</p>

<p>That is an excellent little volume to give one an idea
of the kind of international clashes that are continually
occurring in Edinburgh nowadays. But we, being more

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Our</span> stay in Edinburgh has come to an end. It has
been a delightful month in spite of the weather.
Claudius Clear says, "Edinburgh is so beautiful that, for
love of her face, she is forgiven her bitter east winds,"
adding that "there is a keenness, a rawness,
a chilliness in the air, which you do not find
in South Britain." So there is, and yet we have been out
of doors a great deal, and have threaded her streets and
closes, and climbed her heights in every direction&mdash;Arthur's
Seat, Salisbury Crags, Calton Hill, The Castle,
Corstorphine, The Braid Hills, The Pentlands&mdash;and
made excursions to the Forth Bridge, Hawthornden, Rosslyn,
Duddingston (where the minister most kindly showed
us, between showers, everything of interest in and around
the little church in which Sir Walter Scott was once an
elder), Craigmillar Castle, Musselburgh, North Berwick,
Bass Rock (the dungeons of which were once filled with
Covenanters, whose only offence was adhering to the form
of religion which the king had bound himself by his coronation
oath to maintain), Tantallon Castle, with its memories
of <i>Marmion</i>, and Rullion Green, with its memories
of the Martyrs, and, of course, within the city, Greyfriars
Churchyard, The Grassmarket, Holyrood and the rest.
What a wealth of beauty and history and romance!</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Seamy Side
of Edinburgh.</div>

<p>Yet there are some very criticizable things
about Edinburgh, such as the unseemly billing
and cooing of lovers of the servant class in public
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
places, for instance the Princes Street Gardens, where
they may be seen at almost any hour of the day embracing
each other in the most unblushing manner, apparently
oblivious of the passing multitude. There may be just as
much of this going on in the parks of other cities, but the
peculiar position of these lovely gardens in the great,
green hollow in the very centre of the city, in plain view
of the most crowded streets, and the most popular hotels,
makes this impropriety more obtrusive here than it is anywhere
else.</p>

<p>But worse than this are the ever-present proofs of the
poverty, wretchedness and degradation of great numbers
of the people. The slums of Edinburgh are more constantly
in evidence than those of any other city in the
world. The reason for this is not that the slums are more
populous or worse than those of other cities, but that the
parts of Edinburgh which are of the greatest interest to
visitors, viz., the High Street, from the Castle to Holyrood,
and the adjacent districts, where the great families
once lived, and where the most memorable events of the
city's history occurred, the parts made familiar to all
readers by the writings of Sir Walter Scott and the historians
of Scotland, have long since been abandoned by
the better classes, and are now occupied by the poorest
and most degraded. So that every reading person who
visits Edinburgh is brought face to face, day after day,
with all this squalor and misery; and it is so different
from what one naturally expects to find in Scotland, and
especially in this ancient and wealthy seat of learning,
that it makes a very strong impression upon the imagination&mdash;an
impression so strong that it is scarcely counterbalanced,
even by long sojourn in the scrupulously
clean residential sections, on either side of this filthy and
festering centre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cause of her
Wretchedness.</div>

<p>Why should there be such a plague spot in
the heart of Edinburgh? The explanation
cannot be found in any lack of native ability on the part
of Scotchmen to overcome the conditions that bring about
abject poverty. It is universally conceded that in the
qualities which make for success in life the Scots are
well-nigh unrivalled. Mr. Andrew Carnegie is a pre-eminent
example, but the thrift of Scotchmen in general
is a proverb.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Nor can the explanation of the dire poverty and
wretchedness seen in Scotch cities be found in their disregard
of the Sabbath rest and the Sabbath worship, as
in the case of some other European peoples, though there
seems to be of late some relaxation of their rigid sabbatarianism.
Their strictness in this matter has been the
subject of many a good story. One is told of a little girl
in Aberdeen, who brought a basket of strawberries to the
minister's, very early Monday morning.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my little girl, they are very nice,", said
the minister; "but I hope you did not pick them yesterday,
for it was Sunday, you know."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied the child, "but," she added, with
some dismay, "they were growing all day yesterday."</p>

<p>A devout Scottish minister once stopped at a country
inn, in the northern part of his native land, to pass the
Sunday. The day was rainy and close, and toward night,
as he sat in the little parlor of the inn, he suggested to his
landlady that it would be desirable to have one of the
windows raised, so that they might have some fresh air in
the room.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>
<p>"Mon," said the old woman, with stern disapproval
written plainly on her rugged face, "dinna ye ken that ye
can hae no fresh air in this hoose on the Sawbath?"</p>

<p>Another is related by Dr. Thomas Guthrie, in his
autobiography. It was Sunday morning, and Guthrie was
preaching, away from home. After breakfast, he asked
his host for a cup of hot water to shave with. "Whist,
whist," was the response; "if ye wanted hot water for
your toddy, 'twould be all right; but if this congregation
kenned that ye called for water to shave with, there wad
nae be a soul in the kirk to hear ye."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Curse of
Strong Drink.</div>

<p>This last incident brings us in sight of the
true explanation of Edinburgh's misery.
The great curse of Scotland is drunkenness. The real
cause of the deplorable change that seems to be taking
place in the character of her people is intemperance. Mr.
Charles E. Price, of the well-known firm of McVittie &amp;
Price, who is the prospective Liberal candidate for the
Central Division of Edinburgh, in a recent address, made
after a visit to our country, says he was struck with the
general sobriety of the American people. He did not see
eight persons drunk on the streets during his three
months' tour, and he contrasts this showing with the
gross drunkenness seen on the streets of Edinburgh.
He quotes the startling figures in the letter of Lord Balfour
of Burleigh, to the Lord Provost of Glasgow,
taken from the annual report of the Commissioners of
Prisons, according to which the number of commitments
during the twelve months, 1900-1901, was, for England,
571 per hundred thousand of the population, and for
Ireland, 793, and for Scotland, 1,402! That is, nearly
twice as many for Scotland as for Ireland, and nearly
three times as many for Scotland as for England. "Ah!"
I said to myself sorrowfully, "whiskey again." Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
was the comment of Mr. John A. Steuart, the Scottish
author and social reformer, when this shocking official
statement appeared in the newspapers; and, referring to
Lord Balfour of Burleigh's declaration, that the time has
come when it is necessary to consider whether a large new
prison should not be erected, he adds, "That is the commentary
of your Secretary of State on the morality of the
countrymen of John Knox." Mr. Steuart goes on to show
that the national drink bill, direct and indirect, amounts
to the enormous sum of £300,000,000. "Three hundred
millions sterling and one hundred thousand human lives,
that is the yearly expense of maintaining the publican.
The South African war cost us altogether 20,000 lives;
during the period it lasted the drink traffic cost us upwards
of 250,000, that is to say, for every soldier who
died in South Africa, from wounds or disease, twelve
men and women in Britain perished miserably from strong
drink. Let Christian people think of it.... Nothing
is more certain than this, that religion and the drink
traffic cannot flourish together, and one of them is flourishing
terribly now.... If the church does not gird
herself promptly and vigorously to dispose of the drink
traffic, the drink traffic will assuredly dispose of the
church." In an American journal I find the
statement that, in writing to Dr. T. L. Cuyler
recently, sending him a generous contribution to the
National Temperance Society, Mr. Andrew Carnegie,
after expressing his deep interest in the temperance cause,
added, "The best temperance lecture I have delivered
lately was my offer of ten per cent. premium on their
wages to all employees on my Scottish estates who will
abstain from intoxicating liquors."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Mr. Carnegie
Thinks.</div>

<p>Speaking still more recently, at an entertainment at
Govan, Scotland, Mr. Carnegie said "he wished his countrymen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
would take to their hearts that the one blot upon
the people of Scotland was that they often fell from true
manhood through the use of intoxicating liquor. There
was a saying in America that a totally abstaining Scotsman
could not be beaten, and wherever a Scot has fallen,
it was, in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred, the result
of intemperance. Every Scotsman at home or abroad had
in his keeping part of the honor of Scotland, and Scotland
having so much more honor per man than other
lands, it followed that every Scot carried a greater load
of honor than the man of other lands. He wished that
every word of his to workmen in Scotland would cause
them to reflect upon that, and to resolve that henceforth
they would never disgrace either themselves or the land
that gave them birth. The only defect of the Scot, compared
with the man of other lands, was that of intemperance,
which, however, he rejoiced to know, was steadily
decreasing."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Lesser
Menace.</div>

<p>One other ominous feature of present day
conditions in Scotland I find referred to in
the following clipping from a British journal:</p>

<p>"In Edinburgh of late the Jesuits have been showing
unwonted activity. Owing partly to the unsettling effect
of Biblical criticism upon the average mind, and partly to
some utterances by some of the leading ministers in the
Scottish churches, the Society has evidently deemed the
moment opportune for pressing the claims of Rome upon
the Scottish people. In their spokesman, Father Power,
who addresses a great gathering every Sabbath evening
in the open, they have an instrument well fitted for their
purpose. Of fine presence, manifest learning, and no
mean orator, he is bound to make an impression on some
minds. Here is one sentence from his last lecture. After
referring to the utterance of a noted Scottish divine in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the General Assembly, reflecting on some passage in the
Confession of Faith, he said, 'So that fundamental basis
being removed (the Confession), the Presbyterian Church
collapsed like a house of cards. And hence I say that the
Catholic Church has an opportunity, let us hope a God-given
one, for entering the field once occupied by our late
lamented sister.'"</p>

<p>But he would be a sanguine man, indeed, who could
believe that the people of Scotland generally would ever
become Roman Catholics. For one thing, there is too
much printing there. For the Vicar of Croyden was a
true prophet when he said, in the early days of the Reformation,
"We must root out printing, or printing will
root out us."</p>

<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">Glasgow</span>, <i>September 1, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">From</span> Stirling Castle we revelled in the view which
many consider the finest in Scotland, embracing, as it
does, both Lowland and Highland scenery. We drove
to the towering, but rather top-heavy Wallace Monument,
on Abbey Crag, and climbed its winding stone stairway,
for the sake of another look at that smiling landscape, and
a nearer view of the scene of Wallace's victory over
Surrey at Stirling Bridge, in 1297. In one of the rooms
of this great monument we gazed reverently on the hero's
sword with a thrill of our boyhood enthusiasm over <i>Scottish
Chiefs</i>, remembering that "the sword which looked
heavy for an archangel to wield was light in his terrible
hand." The statue of Wallace in front of the building
looked like an old friend, because of our familiarity with
the replica of it in Druid Hill Park, presented to the city
of Baltimore by Mr. William Wallace Spence. Of course,
we drove, too, to "Cambuskenneth's fane," and the field
of Bannockburn, where the "bore stone" may still be seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memorials of
the Martyrs.</div>

<p>But the place that interested us most at Stirling
was the Old Greyfriars Churchyard,
adjoining the Castle, with its monuments of John Knox,
Alexander Henderson, Andrew Melville, and especially
James Renwick and Margaret Wilson. During our stay
in Edinburgh we had read and talked much of the martyrs
of Scotland, those glorious men and women who had died
for Christ's crown and covenant in "the killing time,"&mdash;those
heroic ministers, nobles, and peasants, male and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
female, who to the number of eighteen thousand had laid
down their lives rather than submit to the tyranny and
popery of the Stuarts. We had visited repeatedly Greyfriars
Churchyard at Edinburgh, where the Covenant was
signed, and where many of the martyrs who were beheaded
in the adjoining Grassmarket are buried. The
last of those who "kissed the Red Maiden" here was the
youthful and gifted James Renwick. His statue at Stirling
represents a mere stripling indeed. Not far from
Renwick's statue stands the most beautiful of all the
monuments of the Covenanters, the snow white group of
Margaret and Agnes Wilson, and the figure of an angel
standing by them. The inscription is as follows:</p>

<div class="bq">
<p class="center">MARGARET,</p>

Through faith Margaret Wilson, a youthful maiden,
chose rather to depart and be with Christ than to
disown His holy Cause and Covenant, to own Erastian
usurpation, and conform to prelacy enforced by
cruel laws. Bound to a stake within flood mark of
the Solway tide, she died a martyr's death on 11th
May, 1685.</p>

  <div class="caption">MONUMENT TO MARGARET WILSON, STIRLING.</div>
</div>

<p>I had had the satisfaction, on my former visit to Scotland,
of seeing many of the places around which the heroism
of the Covenanters has thrown imperishable renown,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
Bothwell Bridge, Drumclog, Ayrsmoss, Wigtown (where
a noble monument to Margaret Wilson and Margaret
McLachlan crowns the highest hill and overlooks the
sad sands of Wigtown, which all readers of <i>The
Men of the Moss Hags</i> will remember), also the
little Duchrae (where, by the way, Mr. S. R. Crockett
was born), and Earlstoun Castle on Ken Water, and Sanquhar.
At Dumfries one morning, I had eaten my breakfast
in the room where Charles Edward, the Pretender,
the last of the Stuarts to curse and trouble the united
kingdom, had dined with his staff, the night before his
final withdrawal northward; and at Sanquhar, in the
afternoon of the same day, I had eaten my dinner close to
the granite shaft which marks the spot where Richard
Cameron and the other twenty heroes sat their horses on
that memorable day, when they unfurled the blue silken
banner, with its inscription in letters of gold "For Christ's
Crown and Covenant," and flashed their swords in the
sunlit air, and declared themselves independent of the
tyrannical and perjured house of Stuart&mdash;one of the sublimest
actions in the history of human freedom&mdash;and the
twenty men won, though they themselves perished in the
conflict. As I thought of it all, and how much it meant
for the civil and religious liberty of our own country, I
had taken off my hat, and, standing there in the street,
had silently thanked God for the gift to Scotland and the
world of such men as Richard Cameron and William Gordon
and James Renwick.</p>

<p>I had a very pleasant note the other day from Mr.
S. R. Crockett, the novelist, in which he was kind enough
to say, "If you are in Galloway, I shall be glad indeed to
see you," and in which he expressed a lively interest in
the work of the "Covenanters" in our church. In speaking
of <i>The Men of the Moss Hags</i>, he says, "I put a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
deal of faithful work into it, but that very quality somewhat
marred the dramatic element. I think of trying
again with a book on <i>Peden</i>&mdash;a red-hot one this time&mdash;not
trying to hold the balance, but going straight for all
persecutors and sitters-at-ease in the Covenant Zion."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Lake
Scenery of
Scotland.</div>

<p>Those who go to The Trossachs by way of
Callander, as most tourists do, and as I did
on my former visit, miss the finest scenery
of this region. Readers of <i>The Lady of the Lake</i> naturally
wish to go by Coilantogle Ford, Clan-Alpine's out-most
bound, but by doing so they miss not only the finest
mountain views of the district, but also the scenes of <i>Rob
Roy</i>, on the upper waters of the Forth. So this time we
went by rail from Stirling to Aberfoyle, spent the night
at the delightful Bailie Nicol Jarvie Hotel, antipodal in
every respect to the wretched inn of the clachan described
by Sir Walter, and took the coach over the mountains
next morning for the Trossachs and Loch Katrine. The
beauty of the mountains, seen in this way, with their rocks
and ferns and heather all around us, and the glittering
lakes far below us, was a revelation even to one who had
been through the district on the other route. At the Loch
Katrine pier we took the little steamer <i>Sir Walter Scott</i>,
and passing Ellen's Isle, were soon favored with another
memorable view. Surely Ben Venue was never lovelier
than it was that day, with the sunlight and shadow alternating
on its rugged sides. The Stronachlachar Hotel,
at the foot of the lake, is another excellent place of entertainment.
We could not tear ourselves away at once, so
after luncheon we rowed on the lake, and climbed on the
rocks, and gathered the heather till late in the afternoon.
Then we took coach for Inversnaid. We thought we had
seen it rain in Scotland. We had not. Those downpours
which had so often drenched us in and around Edinburgh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
were mere showers compared to the floods which fell upon
us on that drive to Inversnaid. The best opportunity I
ever had to observe, in perfect comfort, the effect of a
heavy rain on Highland scenery was on a steamboat ride
up Loch Tay some years ago. From the windows of the
saloon we could see everything on both sides. All the
trickling burns, swollen by the rain, had become full and
foaming streams, and, dashing down the mossy mountains,
gave them the appearance of immense slopes of
green velvet, striped from top to bottom with ribbons of
silver. But on this drive from Stronachlachar to Inversnaid
we were too busy trying to keep ourselves dry to
take account of the effect of the rain on the scenery. We
were much more concerned about its effect upon ourselves.
But on reaching the hotel we hung up our dripping
wraps, and were quite comfortable again in a few
minutes. Next morning was fine. We walked to Rob
Roy's cave in the tumbled rocks overlooking the water.
We climbed the hills above Inversnaid Falls. Some of
the party rowed across the lake to the Arrochar mountains.
From every point of view we were enchanted with
the loveliness of Loch Lomond. It is the largest and
most beautiful of the Scottish lakes. We left Inversnaid
reluctantly, after a too brief stay of a day and a half, and
steamed down to Balloch. Taking the cars there for
Glasgow, we soon came in sight of the gray stone mansion
of Lord Overtoun, standing high and clear to the view
on our left. The sight of it rendered the senior member
of the party reminiscent again, and he told the others of
the garden party given there to the Pan-Presbyterian
Council in 1896.</p>

<p>About 850 people had come by rail from Glasgow to
Dumbarton on a specially chartered train, and were conveyed
the two or three miles from there to Overtoun in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
breaks, thirty-five in number. Over the door of the mansion
ran the chiselled words, "Let everything that hath
breath praise the Lord." The host and Lady Overtoun
received the delegates in the hall. After passing through
the elegant apartments on the first floor, they dispersed
over the beautiful grounds where ices were served at
various places, and ten pipers of the celebrated Black
Watch, in their picturesque Highland costume, marched
up and down the lawn, playing their national instrument,
one which, with its "tangled squeaking," as Hawthorne
calls it, has always seemed to me more picturesque than
musical. At four o'clock the guests, to the number of
nearly one thousand, all assembled in the great marquee
which had been erected on the lawn, and were seated at
tables for refreshments, after which they were welcomed
by Lord Overtoun in a most cordial speech, to which
responses were made by Dr. Roberts, Dr. Blaikie, Dr.
Hoge, Rev. John McNeill and others, and at about six
o'clock we all went back to Glasgow, fully agreed that this
was far and away the most elaborate and elegant entertainment
we had ever seen.</p>

<p>One of the raciest men I met at Glasgow, on that
occasion, was the Rev. John McNeill. I had the good
fortune, with some other friends, to travel in the same
compartment with him the day we went to Lord Overtoun's
Garden Party. Noticing the river through the car
window, he began to speak of the filth of the Clyde below
Glasgow, and then naturally enough of the Chicago river,
which is probably the filthiest ditch on this planet, and
quoted the remark he had made while there, that Peter
could have walked on the Chicago river without faith.
This led him to speak of exaggerations in general, one
especially in which a local Scotch orator indulged when
offering the congratulations of his community to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
owner of three or four small coasting vessels when he was
about launching another one. After "disporting himself
in the empyrean," as Dr. Alexander used to say of such
sky-scrapers, this bailie wound up with the statement that
"the sails of your ships whiten the universal seas." The
local minister was the next speaker, but after such a burst
of eloquence as the foregoing, his remarks were, of
course, very tame, so much so that the bailie who had
covered himself with glory turned to another bailie sitting
next to him, and said, "Bailie, mon, some o' them
that have never been to college can make a better speech
than them that have been through <i>the hale corrycolium</i>!"</p>

<p>Another example of unconscious Scotch humor, related,
I think, in Lockhart's <i>Life of Scott</i>, was that of the
pastor of the small islands of Cumbrae, near the mouth of
the Clyde, who was accustomed to pray that the Lord
would "bless Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae and <i>the
adjacent islands</i> of Great Britain and Ireland." Still another
was that of the simple Highlanders on the estates
of the great Presbyterian nobleman, the Duke of Argyll,
who when the Duke's son, the Marquis of Lorne, married
the daughter of Queen Victoria, said, "The Queen must
be a great woman if her daughter could marry the son of
McCallum More."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The City of
Glasgow.</div>

<p>"Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of
the word." From time immemorial that has
been the motto of this stately city, now the second in size
in Great Britain, numbering some nine hundred thousand
souls. It should, therefore, be no surprise that there are
<i>two hundred and seventy-five</i> Presbyterian churches here.
"Glasgow is the largest Presbyterian city in the world,
whether it be measured by the number of churches, of
communicants, or of aggressive work done in the cause
of Christ." It was in Glasgow that the first missionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
society, to send the gospel to the heathen world, was
formed in Scotland. Glasgow was also the principal scene
of the great home mission enterprise of Dr. Chalmers.
Thus, as Prof. Lindsay says, Glasgow has taken the lead
in the two greatest characteristics of modern evangelical
Presbyterianism&mdash;missions to the heathen, and to the
lapsed and drifting population at home. Besides what is
raised by the churches of the city, Glasgow spends annually
more than seven hundred thousand dollars in the
support of various charitable institutions. For instance,
over nine hundred orphan children are cared for in the
"homes," all the money for buildings and daily bread
being sent in, in answer to prayer. Eighty-eight services
are held on Sabbath forenoons for non-churchgoing lads
and girls, superintended by two thousand monitors and
workers. The Boys' Brigade took its rise in Glasgow.
There are ten thousand young men enrolled as members
of the Young Men's Christian Association. These bare
statements will give some idea of the religious activities
of this great Presbyterian city, and of its suitableness as a
rallying centre, in 1896, for the three hundred representatives
of that vast army of more than twenty million
people of God, who, in every nation under heaven, march

Church in the world.</p>

<p>Glasgow is, moreover, an ancient seat of learning,
and a great centre of commerce. For five hundred
years its University has shed light over Scotland,
and other countries as well. As for primary education,
the official report says, "it is a rare thing now
to find a child in the city, over ten or eleven years of age,
who cannot read and write. Its art galleries, museums,
music, lectures, its magnificent municipal buildings
erected at a cost of two million six hundred thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
dollars, its sanitary arrangements, under the influence of
which the rate of mortality is steadily decreasing, its
water system, which, at a cost of seventeen million five
hundred dollars, has brought an abundant supply of pure
water from Loch Katrine through thirty-five miles of
mountainous country&mdash;all are worthy of the second city
of the kingdom. And, as everybody knows, Glasgow is
the place where "the stately ocean greyhounds" are built.
Fifty-five million dollars have been expended in "turning
what was once a little salmon stream into one of the
greatest navigable highways of the world." In 1768, the
Clyde, at low water, was one foot deep, where now it is
twenty-four feet. What is it that has given this venerable
Presbyterian city this proud position, next to London?
"Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Old
Cathedral.</div>

<p>It is said that the word "Glasgow" comes
from "Glescu," gray mist. It deserved its
name when we arrived there on the 30th of August, 1902,
and it continued to deserve it throughout our stay. The
fog was so heavy and dense that one felt almost as if it
could be sawn into slabs.</p>

<p>I can testify further that the city deserved its name
also on the 17th of June, 1896, when the delegates
to the Sixth General Council of the Reformed Churches
Throughout the World Holding the Presbyterian System,
gathered in the Barony Church, and marched through a
cold rain, across the wide paved square, to the ancient
cathedral, where the opening sermon was to be preached.
This majestic building, now more than seven hundred
years old, is thus described by Sir Walter Scott in the
nineteenth chapter of <i>Rob Roy</i>, "The pile is of a gloomy
and massive, rather than of an elegant, style of Gothic
architecture; but its peculiar character is so strongly
preserved, and so well suited with the accompaniments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
which surround it, that the impression of the first view
was solemn and awful in the extreme." As Andrew Fairservice
said to the hero of that stirring story, whom Scott
represents as addressed by Rob Roy from behind one of
the pillars in the crypt, "It's a brave kirk&mdash;nane o' yer
whigmalieries and curliewurlies and opensteek hems about
it&mdash;a solid, weel-jointed mason-wark, that will stand as
long as the world, keep hands and gunpowder aff it."
And, indeed, it looks as if it would. On the crest of the
hill, in the adjacent necropolis, stands a splendid Doric
column surmounted by a statue of John Knox.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Most Eminent
Citizen
of Glasgow.</div>

<p>The Preëminence of Scotland in Theology,
Philosophy, and Medicine has long been
recognized the world over. But it may not
be known to all of my readers that the most eminent
scientist now living is also a resident of this country, a
citizen of Glasgow&mdash;Lord Kelvin.</p>

<p>In the Regalia Room of Edinburgh Castle, on my way
to Glasgow in 1896, I had the pleasure of meeting, for the
first time, one of the most intellectual young men that the
South has produced since the war, Professor Woodrow
Wilson, of Princeton University, a former fellow student
at Davidson College of one of my fellow-travellers at
that time. He told us he was on his way to Glasgow, too,
for the purpose of representing Princeton in the celebration
of Lord Kelvin's jubilee. This veteran professor,
who thus completed fifty years of service as a teacher in
the University of Glasgow, and who, by the way, like so
many other epoch-makers, is a Scotch-Irishman, has long
been recognized as one of the most eminent scientists of
modern times, and the greatest of all electricians. As
Professor William Thomson, he first won renown by the
wonder which he wrought in annihilating space by enabling
us to telegraph across the Atlantic ocean, for it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
he who solved the difficulty which, in 1856, threatened to
defeat all the plans of the late Cyrus W. Field just as he
seemed about to realize his gigantic dream of uniting two
continents. The signals passing through a long submarine
cable were found to "drag" so much as to make it
practically useless. Thomson discovered the law governing
the retardation, and invented the "mirror instrument,"
by which all the delicate fluctuations of the varying current
could be interpreted. "So sensitive is the arrangement
that on one occasion a signal was sent to America
and back through two Atlantic cables with the current
from a toy battery, made in a silver thimble with a drop
of acidulated water and a grain of zinc." By means of
Thomson's magical apparatus, on August 17, 1858, this
message was flashed from shore to shore, "Europe and
America are united by telegraph: Glory to God in the
highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." For
this success he was knighted. In 1892, after many other
successes, he was raised to the peerage. The submarine
telegraph is not the only invention which connects his
name with the sea. By substituting piano-forte wire for
the old-fashioned rope, he made it possible to measure
quickly and accurately the depth of water at any spot
under a moving ship. When Dr. Toule was visiting Prof.
Thomson, he noticed a bundle of this piano-forte wire,
and, inquiring what it was for, was informed by Thomson
that he intended using it for "sounding purposes."
"What note?" innocently inquired Toule, to which Thomson
promptly replied, "The deep C." But Lord Kelvin's
most valuable aid to navigation is the adjustable compass,
which bears his name, and which is now used on every
first-class ship in the world.</p>

<p>So numerous and useful are his inventions that there
is an establishment at Glasgow devoted solely to the manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
of his patents, and employing nearly two hundred
highly skilled workmen, and a staff of electricians.
His home, in the precincts of Glasgow University, was the
first house in the world to be lighted with electricity. It
is not strange, then, that we found the whole city doing
him honor on our arrival in 1896, and scores of scholars
convened to offer the congratulations of other institutions
in every part of the world.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had the pleasure of hearing a very
thoughtful and striking sermon from the Rev. P. Carnegie
Simpson, author of <i>The Fact of Christ</i>, a book which in a
very short time has gained a deservedly wide circulation.
I am constrained to believe that, generally speaking, Scottish
ministers have more intellectual ability and better
theological furnishing than those in America.</p>

<span class="smcap">Caledonian Canal</span>, <i>September 3, 1902</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> fog was so thick the morning we steamed down
the ill-smelling Clyde, and out through the Kyles of
Bute, that we could see nothing whatever, and had to
content ourselves as best we could with the tantalizing
recollections of one member of the party, who on a former
occasion had made an excursion with some five hundred
other persons, delegates to the Glasgow Council and their
friends, on the elegant steamer, <i>Duchess of Hamilton</i>, up
Loch Long, Loch Goil, and the Kyles of Bute, with alternating
showers and sunshine, getting charming views of
the lovely scenery that abounds about the Firth of Clyde.
But the atmosphere lightened somewhat as we steamed
through the Crinan Canal, and as we approached Oban
it cleared completely, and gave us full opportunity to
enjoy the glorious scenery on every hand.</p>

<p>Situated near the southern terminus of the Caledonian
Canal, and also not far from the western isles, and being
the starting point of all excursions through this, the
wildest and most romantic region of Scotland, Oban is
called "the Charing Cross of the Highlands."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rude Seas
off the West
Coast.</div>

<p>The first excursion undertaken by our party
from Oban was the famous one to Staffa
and Iona, and in this we were so fortunate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
that we almost forgot our disappointment at the Kyles
of Bute. Frequently the sea is so rough in this windy
region that passengers cannot be landed on the islands.
It was so on the day before our trip, and also on the day
after it. It seemed to us rough enough on the day we
made the trip, and the captain was doubtful about landing
us until the very last. But the boats from shore put out
and came alongside, swinging on the waves five or six
feet up, and then quickly down again, so that it was
necessary for us to step in promptly, one by one, just at
the moment when they rose to the highest point. It
looked dangerous, but nobody backed out. It looked still
more dangerous after we were in the tossing boats, with
the great green waves running high all around us. I
think several of the party had doubts whether they would
ever again set foot on land, and there were thankful
hearts and deep sighs of relief when, after the visit to
Staffa, we all got safe back on the steamer. The danger,
however, was more apparent than real. The boats were
staunch, strongly manned, and handled with consummate
skill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Iona and
Columba.</div>

<p>We visited Iona first, a small island and
homely, but sacred and memorable forever
as the place where the presbyter abbot, Columba, the
Apostle of Caledonia, and his twelve companions from
Ireland, landed in A. D. 563, to begin that series of toilsome,
but marvellously successful campaigns, which resulted
in the evangelization of a large part of Scotland.
The tomb of Columba is still shown in the ancient cathedral.
For centuries Iona was a part of the domain of the
Duke of Argyll, but three or four years ago the late Duke,
the author of <i>The Reign of Law</i>, presented the property
to the Church of Scotland. Since that time the cathedral
has been re-roofed and otherwise restored, so that now it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
presents a less desolate appearance than it did on my first
visit a few years ago. Iona was the burial place of the
ancient Scottish kings. More than fifty of them lie in the
cemetery, hard by the cathedral, in graves marked, for
the most part, by ancient tombstones, with interesting inscriptions.
The last of these kings to be laid here was
Duncan I., who was murdered by Macbeth about the
middle of the eleventh century. Not far away stands
Maclean's Cross, supposed to be the oldest in Scotland.
It is one of three hundred and sixty Iona crosses which
are said to have once stood on the island.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Staffa and
Fingal's Cave.</div>

<p>Half an hour from Iona by the steamer is
Staffa. Staffa means the "isle of columns."
It is of the same columnar basaltic formation as the
Giant's Causeway in the north of Ireland, and was produced
by the same outpouring of lava that formed the
Irish Causeway. We climbed along the irregular floor
of perfectly formed polygonal columns, which fit each
other with absolute exactness, though no two are alike.
We stopped for a moment to sit down in Fingal's Wishing
Chair, and then pushed on to see the most impressive of
all these natural wonders&mdash;Fingal's Cave&mdash;which penetrates
the volcanic columns for a distance of two hundred
and twenty-seven feet.</p>

<p>This stupendous basaltic grotto in the lonely Isle of
Staffa remained, singularly enough, unknown to the outer
world until visited by Sir Joseph Banks in 1772. As the
visitors' boat glides under its vast portal, the mighty
octagonal columns of lava, which form the sides of the
cavern&mdash;the depth and strength of the tide which rolls
its deep and heavy swell into the extremity of the vault
unseen amid its vague uncertainty&mdash;the variety of tints
formed by the white, crimson, and yellow stalactites which
occupy the base of the broken pillars that form the roof,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and intersect them with a rich and variegated chasing&mdash;the
corresponding variety of tint below water, where the
ocean rolls over a dark red or violet-colored rock, from
which the basaltic columns rise&mdash;the tremendous noise
of the swelling tide mingling with the deep-toned echoes
of the vault that stretches far into the bowels of the isle&mdash;form
a combination of effects without a parallel in the
world!</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott's lines express the sentiment most
proper to the place:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great
Canal.</div>

<p>The trip from Oban to Inverness, through
the Caledonian Canal, with its alternating
locks and lochs, and its mountain walls on either side, is
one of the finest in the world in point of scenery. It was
something of a surprise to us to find at Fort Augustus,
half way up the canal, the Benedictine Order established
in a magnificent group of buildings, which had been
erected at a cost of four hundred thousand dollars, but we
presently remembered that there had always been a Roman
Catholic element in the Highlands, that this element
had ardently supported the pretensions of Charles Edward
Stuart to the British crown, and that Lord Lovat, the
leading Roman Catholic nobleman of the region, had been
executed for the treasonable part he took in that affair.
In the Tower of London we had seen the block on which
he was beheaded, with the print of the axe showing
plainly in the wood. In 1876 the Lord Lovat of that
time presented this splendid property to the Benedictines.
Of Prince Charlie's career in this part of Scotland we
shall have more to say in our next letter.</p>

Macdonald lived during a portion of her maturer life, I

younger days, when, at the peril of her own life, she saved
the worthless life of Prince Charles Stuart, the Young
Pretender to the British throne.</p>

<p>Students of that period of English history, or readers
of <i>Waverly</i>, that immortal romance, which, as the first
venture of its then unknown author in this line of literature,
gave its name to the whole series of those unrivalled
historical romances which were put forth thereafter in
rapid succession by Sir Walter Scott, and which have
given a greater amount of wholesome pleasure to the
world of readers in general than any other series of books
that were ever written&mdash;students of history and readers
of <i>Waverly</i>, I say, will remember, that after the Pretender's
delusive victory at Prestonpans, near Edinburgh,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
and his disappointment at the failure of the Roman Catholic
population of western England to rise in support of
his cause, he fell back to the northern part of Scotland,
and there, on the desolate moor of Culloden, four miles
from Inverness, he was overwhelmingly defeated by the
Duke of Cumberland, and his army of devoted Highlanders
cut to pieces. Over that bloody field the star of
the Stuarts, a race which had so long been a curse to
Great Britain, sank to rise no more, and the Protestant
succession has never since been seriously called in question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Fugitive in
the Hebrides.</div>

<p>The Pretender, with a few faithful friends,
fled through the wild country to the southwest,
and, after many hardships and hairbreadth escapes,
reached the Outer Hebrides, and was concealed in a cave
there, on the wet and windy island of Benbecula. But
the fact that he was on this island soon became known to
the government, and then his position became perilous in
the extreme. By sea and land every precaution was taken
to prevent his escape, every road, pass and landing place
being guarded, and the whole coast being patrolled by
government vessels in such numbers that no craft, however
small, could approach or leave the island unobserved,
except perhaps under cover of darkness by special good
fortune, while some two thousand soldiers made diligent
search on shore; in addition to which a prize of one hundred
and fifty thousand dollars was offered for his capture.
In this crisis of his affairs it was agreed that a final
attempt for his rescue should be made through the agency
of a young lady of the neighborhood, Miss Flora Macdonald,
then twenty-four years of age, two years younger
than the Prince himself, but whose selection for his perilous
office argues a prudence and strength of character far
beyond her years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A woman
to the Rescue.</div>

<p>This remarkable young woman was well
born, being the granddaughter of the Rev.
Angus Macdonald, known throughout the Isles as "the
strong minister," on account of his extraordinary physical
strength. She was also well bred, and well educated,
having enjoyed not only the advantages of her own home,
and of the other respectable families of her native island,
but also the benefit of long residence in the home of her
kinsman, Sir Alexander Macdonald, of Monkstadt, in the
Island of Skye, and of three years in the Ladies' Seminary
of Miss Henderson, at Edinburgh. Sir Alexander was
loyal to the house of Hanover, and had refused to take
any part in supporting the pretensions of Prince Charles.
Flora also was indifferent to the claim of the Stuarts, and
saved the Pretender's life out of pure compassion. Indeed,
afterwards, when she had been released from her
imprisonment at London on the charge of treason, and
the Prince of Wales called on her and asked her, half
jocularly, how she dared to assist a rebel against his
father's throne, she answered with characteristic simplicity
and firmness that she would have done the same thing for
him had she found him in like distress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Feminine
Courage and
Resource.</div>

<p>The plan adopted, and successfully carried
out, for the escape of the Pretender from
Benbecula to Skye was this: Our heroine,
having expressed a strong desire to visit her mother, then
living in Skye, procured a passport for herself and two
servants from her stepfather, Captain Hugh Macdonald,
who, though in command of a body of the King's militia
on Benbecula, shared the general compassion for the
beaten Prince, and the general desire that he might escape
with his life. One of these servants was Neil Macdonald,
a faithful, intelligent, and pretty well educated youth,
who had spent several years in Paris, and, therefore, spoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
French fluently, and who, after the adventures with which
we are here concerned, followed the Pretender to France,
and became the father of the celebrated Marshal Macdonald,
Duke of Tarentum, one of Napoleon's great generals.
The other, ostensibly an awkward and overgrown Irish
girl, was in reality Prince Charles himself. With the
principal member of the party thus disguised, and armed
with the passport for use in case of need, these three, with
a picked boat crew of six, set out on a dark night when the
rain was falling in torrents, and, after an exceedingly
tempestuous and perilous voyage, arrived safely in Skye,
where the coolness, courage and resourcefulness of Flora
Macdonald baffled the King's officers, overcame all difficulties,
and eventually accomplished the desired end of
getting the Pretender to the mainland, whence, after three
months more of severe hardships, he got aboard of a
French vessel, and so reached the continent. That he
was utterly unworthy of the great service rendered him,
is clearly shown by the fact, that though he lived for more
than forty-two years after he parted with her on the beach
of Portree, he never acknowledged, by letter or otherwise,
the dangers to which she exposed herself in order to
save his life. At his death his body was appropriately laid
in St. Peter's Cathedral at Rome with the rest of his
Romish kindred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flora Macdonald
as Prisoner.</div>

<p>Flora Macdonald's part in the escape of the
young Pretender could not long be concealed.
As soon as it became known she was arrested,
and taken on board one of the King's vessels, and by
General Campbell sent to Dunstaffnage Castle, on Loch
Etive, his note to the governor of the castle referring to
her as "a very pretty young rebel." After ten days of
imprisonment there, she was taken to Leith, the port of
Edinburgh, and placed on board the <i>Bridgewater</i>, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
she was detained for nearly three months, being lionized
the while by the aristocracy and professional men of the
Scottish metropolis in a way that would have turned a
weaker head. An Episcopal clergyman of the place wrote
of her as follows:</p>

<p>"Although she was easy and cheerful, yet she had a
certain mixture of gravity in all her behavior, which
became her situation exceedingly well, and set her off to
great advantage. She is of a low stature, of a fair complexion,
and well enough shaped. One would not discern
by her conversation that she had spent all her former days
in the Highlands, for she talks English easily, and not at
all through the Erse tone. She has a sweet voice, and
sings well; and no lady, Edinburgh-bred, can acquit herself
better at the tea-table, than what she did when in
Leith Roads. Her wise conduct, in one of the most perplexing
scenes that can happen in life&mdash;her fortitude and
good sense&mdash;are memorable instances of the strength of
a female mind, even in those years that are tender and
inexperienced."</p>

<p>In November, 1746, the <i>Bridgewater</i> sailed, with our
heroine and others, to London, where they were to stand
trial on charges of treason. Her popularity, however, was
so great, and public sentiment so strongly opposed to the
infliction of any stern penalty upon a young and attractive
woman for the performance of a self-sacrificing act of
humanity, that, after a short confinement in the gloomy
Tower of London, whose walls have enclosed so many
heavy hearts in the course of the centuries, she was turned
over to friends, who became responsible to the government
for her appearance when demanded, and, after remaining
a state prisoner in this mitigated manner for some
twelve months, she was set at liberty, under the Act of
Indemnity of 1747. The first use she made of her freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
was to solicit as a special favor that her fellow-prisoners
from the Isles should be given the same liberty as herself,
and the request was granted, one of those thus released
being her future father-in-law, Macdonald of Kingsburgh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her Marriage.</div>

<p>Some three years after her return to her
native islands, she was married, in 1750, to
Allan Macdonald. Boswell, in his <i>Journal of a Tour to
the Hebrides</i>, thus describes the man to whom our heroine
yielded her heart and hand:</p>

<p>"He was completely the figure of a gallant Highlander,
exhibiting the graceful mien and manly looks which our
popular Scotch song has justly attributed to that character.
He had his tartan plaid thrown around him, a large
blue bonnet with a knot of black ribbon like a cockade, a
brown short coat, a tartan waistcoat with gold buttons, a
bluish philibeg, and tartan hose. He had jet-black hair,
tied behind, and was a large, stately man, with a steady,
sensible countenance."</p>

<div class="sidenote">She Entertains
Dr. Johnson
and Boswell.</div>

<p>It was in 1773 that Boswell and Dr. Samuel
Johnson were entertained at the hospitable
home of Allan Macdonald and his famous
wife. The great lexicographer and moralist was delighted
with his hostess and describes her as "a woman of middle
stature, soft features, gentle manners, and elegant presence."
He asked her, as a special favor, to let him sleep
in the bed which had been occupied by the unfortunate
Prince, a request which she readily granted, adding, to
his immense gratification, that she would also furnish him
with the identical sheets on which the Prince had lain,
and which, by the way, she kept till the end of her days,
taking them with her to North Carolina and back, and in
which, at her own request, her body was wrapped after
her death. Before leaving the house next morning, Dr.
Johnson laid on his toilet table a slip of paper containing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the pencilled words, <i>Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum</i>,
which Boswell renders, "With virtue weighed, what
worthless trash is gold."</p>

<div class="sidenote">She Moves
to North
Carolina.</div>

<p>Through no mismanagement or extravagance
of his own, but in consequence of
losses incurred by his father, by the part he
had taken in the Pretender's cause, Allan Macdonald had
become seriously embarrassed, and so, in the hope of
mending his fortune, he determined to emigrate to North
Carolina, where many other families from Skye had
already settled. Accordingly, in 1774, with his wife and
their nine children, he sailed for Wilmington, and, after
receiving various attentions there, whither the fame of
his wife had preceded them, they went up the Cape Fear
River to Cross Creek, now called Fayetteville, and after
some months in Cumberland county, where they were
regular worshippers in the Presbyterian Church, purchased
a place on the borders of Richmond and Montgomery
counties, which they named Killiegray.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misfortunes
in the New
World.</div>

<p>Their life in America was a sad one. Two
of their children died, a bereavement made
the more trying to the mother because of
the absence of her husband, whose duties as a military
officer required his presence elsewhere. The Revolutionary
War was on the point of breaking out, and Governor
Martin, seeing the honor paid to Allan Macdonald by the
Highlanders, made him brigadier-general of a command
of his countrymen, which became a part of the ill-fated
army that was defeated by the American patriots at the
battle of Moore's Creek. He was captured and committed
to Halifax jail, Virginia, as a prisoner of war.
With misfortunes thickening around her, her husband in
prison, her five sons away from home in the service of the
King, her youngest daughter enfeebled by a dangerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
attack of typhus fever, and her adopted country in the
throes of war, Flora Macdonald resolved, on the recommendation
of her imprisoned husband, to return to Scotland,
and, having obtained a passport through the kind
offices of Captain Ingram, of the American army, she
went to Wilmington, and later to Charleston, whence she
sailed in 1779.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Her Return
to Scotland
and her
Last Days.</div>

<p>During this voyage she had the last of her
notable adventures, in a sharp action between
the vessel on which she sailed and a
French privateer. She characteristically
refused to take shelter below during the engagement, but
appeared on deck, and encouraged the sailors, assuring
them of success. She had an arm broken in this battle,
and was accustomed to say afterwards that she had fought
both for the house of Stuart and the house of Hanover,
but had been worsted in the service of both.</p>

<p>When peace was restored between Britain and America,
her husband was released from his long imprisonment,
and returned as speedily as possible to Skye, where they
continued to live comfortably and happily for eight or
nine years. She died on the 5th of March, 1790, and was
buried in the churchyard of Kilmuir, in the north end of
Skye, her funeral being more numerously attended than
any other that has ever taken place in the Western Isles.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> finest expanses of heather that we saw in Scotland
were on the great moors through which our
train ran southwards from Inverness, a rolling sea of
pinkish purple bloom, stretching for miles and miles on
every hand. Farther down we enjoyed the picturesqueness
of the Pass of Killiecrankie, but it was the history
here rather than the scenery which interested us, for it
was here that Claverhouse, the stony-hearted persecutor
of the Covenanters, fought and won his last battle, but lost
his own life. Still farther south, at Dunkeld, we were
reminded of the heroic and successful resistance made by
the staunch men of Galloway to the hitherto victorious
Highlanders, well described in Mr. Crockett's <i>Lochinvar</i>,
which, as many of my young readers know, is a sort of
sequel to <i>The Men of the Moss Hags</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In and around

<p>The Tay at Perth is a noble stream. It is
said that when the Romans came in sight
of it, they exclaimed, "Ecce Tiber! Ecce campus Martius!"
The scornful resentment which Scotchmen feel at
this comparison of their beautiful river to the more famous
Italian stream, which Hawthorne somewhere describes
as "a mud puddle in strenuous motion," is expressed
in the lines which Sir Walter Scott has placed
at the head of the first chapter of his <i>Fair Maid of Perth</i>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>It has been whimsically said that Perth is the smallest
city in the world, because it is situated between two
inches. Inch was the old Scottish word denoting an
island or meadow. We were most interested, of course,
in the North Inch, where the judicial combat took place
between the two clans, and in which Henry Wynd and
Conachar were engaged. The name of one of these clans,
the Clan Quhele, reminded me of the thrifty little town
built up by the Highland Scotch element in eastern North
Carolina. They called the town "Quhele." But the other
native elements of the population, not appreciating Scotch
tradition and what seemed to them an outlandish name,
changed it in common use to "Shoe Heel," and this undignified
designation of their town so completely ousted
the other that the people by act of legislature had the
name changed to "Maxton," that is, Mac's Town, for
nine-tenths of the people in that region are Macs, and
mighty good people they are, too. We visited the Fair
Maid's House, and in the evening read the Magician's
romance about her. Through the great kindness of relatives
and boyhood companions of friends of ours in Richmond,
who had the good fortune to be born and brought
up in Perth, we were given every opportunity to see the
interesting old city from every point of view, and both
those of us who climbed to the top of Kinnoul Hill, which
an old traveller once called "the glory of Scotland," and
those of us who drove with the kind friends above mentioned
to Scone Palace, whence the ancient crowning stone
now in Westminster Abbey was taken, were fully agreed
that the place richly deserved its affectionate name of
"The Fair City." One member of our party made an
excursion one day from Perth to Kirriemuir, the
"Thrums" of Mr. Barrie's stories, while two others devoted
the day to an excursion in the other direction to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
beautifully situated town of Crieff, world renowned as a
health resort. Here we were most pleasantly entertained
by the kind friends in whose delightful home I was a
guest at Glasgow in 1896. Any one of the drives about
Crieff on a perfect day, such as we had, will give one a
new impression of the loveliness of Perthshire, the district
of Scotland to which Sir Walter awards the palm for
beauty.</p>

<p>On my former visit, I had made a detour from Perth,
in this same direction, for the purpose of seeing Logiealmond,
the "Drumtochty" of Ian Maclaren, which is only
a few miles from Crieff, and had visited the Free Church,
in which the young pastor of the <i>Bonnie Brier Bush</i>
stories preached "his mother's sermon," and "spoke a
gude word for Jesus Christ"; and the Established Church,
where, under a big elm, the nippy tongue of Jamie Soutar
was wont to wag on Sunday mornings; and the farm of
Burnbrae, and other places in the glen which has now become
so famous. I am sorry to say that Dr. John Watson's
later development, both theological and literary, has
not been so satisfactory as was once expected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Southwest
Scotland and
the English
Lakes.</div>

<p>On our way down to Edinburgh we had a
glimpse from the car windows of Loch
Leven, and the island castle in which Mary
Queen of Scots was confined to keep her
out of mischief, and in connection therewith recalled what
we could of <i>The Monastery</i> and <i>The Abbot</i>, the former
one of the least successful, and the latter one of the most
successful of Scott's romances. We had a glimpse also of
Dunfermline, the birthplace of Andrew Carnegie, to say
nothing of its ancient renown, crossed the Forth Bridge
once more, made a brief stay in Edinburgh, and pushed
on to Ayr, passing the battlefield of Ayrsmoss and other
points of interest in connection with the Covenanters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
We could give only two days to Ayr, but saw the birthplace
of Burns, Auld Alloway Kirk, Bonnie Doon, and
the various memorials of the poet; then went to Dumfries
principally to see the Burns monuments there, passing
reluctantly through the Covenanter country without stopping.
From Dumfries we crossed the border, passing the
original Gretna Green, where for more than a hundred
years the runaway couples from England were married,
and went direct to Keswick, at the head of Derwentwater,
for the purpose of seeing something of the English Lake
District. Skiddaw is a noble and satisfying mountain.
We were interested also in the memorials of Southey at
Crossthwaite Church. But Southey is responsible for the
severest disappointment that comes to travellers in the
Lake District. By his artificial and jingling lines on
"How the water comes down at Lodore," he has raised
expectations which the poor little falls at the foot of
Derwentwater cannot realize. The American who came
there and sat down on a rock and watched the falls for
a while, and then declared that there was at least a gill
of water coming down, was hardly guilty of a greater
exaggeration in one direction than Southey in the other.
But there is no other disappointment about the scenery
of the English Lakes. It is lovely. It is said that a
famous classical scholar, preaching to a small congregation
of rustics in the Lake District, said to them, "In this
beautiful country, my brethren, you have an apotheosis of
nature and an apodeikneusis of theocratic omnipotence!"
We trust that the sentiment which he tried to express was
all right, notwithstanding the insufferably pedantic form
of it. Of course we took the coach from Keswick to
Windermere, stopping for the night at Ambleside, and
visiting the grave of Wordsworth hard by the clear and
placid stream, an ideal resting-place for the poet of nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chester and
Lichfield.</div>

<p>Chester, with its quaint Rows, and red sandstone
cathedral, and its high promenade on
top of the walls encircling the old part of the town, and
especially its Roman remains&mdash;for Chester is fundamentally
a Roman town, as its name indicates (it was the
Castra of the Twentieth Legion)&mdash;interested us, as did
also Eaton Hall, the magnificent seat of the Duke of
Westminster, three miles distant; but we had rain, rain,
rain, and besides, we had lingered so long in the fascinating
"land of the mountain and the flood" that we were
anxious to push on to places of still more interest to us.
So we did not tarry there long. We treated Coventry,
Kenilworth, Leamington, and even Lichfield, in the same
touch-and-go fashion. We could not bring ourselves to
omit Lichfield altogether, partly because of its lovely
cathedral, but chiefly because it was the town of Dr.
Samuel Johnson, the greatest man of books that ever
lived. Therefore, we stopped there long enough to go
through the rich collection of Johnson relics in the house
where he was brought up, to study the monument to him
in the marketplace in front, and to inspect the cathedral.
Boswell's <i>Life of Johnson</i> is the best biography in the
English language. The careful reading of it is a pretty
thorough education in literature. I fear it is not read as
much as it used to be. People are too much occupied with
the ephemeral effusions of contemporary mediocrities to
read the great books.</p>

<p>Our visit to this town reminded me of a story that I
had read years ago of a certain bishop of Lichfield who
had a reputation for repartee and ready replies to difficult
questions. In a crowded room one evening, when it was
not known that the bishop was present, the conversation
turned to this aptness of his, and a man said, "I should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
like to meet that bishop of Lichfield; I'd put a question
to him that would puzzle him."</p>

<p>"Very well," said a voice from another corner, "now
is your time, for I am the bishop."</p>

<p>The first speaker was somewhat taken aback, but recovered
himself sufficiently to say, "Well, my lord, can
you tell me the way to heaven?"</p>

<p>"Nothing easier," answered the bishop, "you have only
to turn to the right and go straight ahead."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Shakespeare
Country.</div>

<p>And now we are off for the Shakespeare
country, not far away. Very different from
the bold scenery of Scotland is that of this part of England.
Here one sees&mdash;</p>

    <div class="verse">A ripple of land, such little hills the sky</div>
    <div class="verse">Can stoop to tenderly and the wheat fields climb."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The most striking feature of an English landscape to
an American eye is the <i>extraordinary finish</i>&mdash;lawns,
fields, fences, houses, roads, are all such as can belong
only to an old and prosperous country. An Oxford man,
when asked how they managed to get such perfect sward
in the college lawns, replied: "It is the simplest thing
in the world; you have only to mow and roll regularly
<i>for about four hundred years</i>."</p>

<p>At Stratford-on-Avon we stayed at the Red Horse
Inn, Washington Irving's hotel when here. We visited
Anne Hathaway's cottage, the school of the poet's boyhood,
the ugly and staring Shakespeare memorial, and
the other points of interest. It is familiar ground to most
readers, and I shall refer to only two things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The American
Window at
Stratford.</div>

<p>In the church where Shakespeare is buried
there is an American window, not yet finished
when I first saw it, and there was a
box hard by to receive the donations of American visitors.
The rich stained glass represents the infant Christ in his
mother's arms, and on either side English and American
worthies in attitudes of adoration. On one side are
Amerigo Vespucci, Christopher Columbus and William
Penn, representative pious <i>Americans</i>, and on the other
Bishop Egwin of Worcester, "King Charles the Martyr
and Archbishop Laud!" The fact that more than two
thousand dollars have been contributed for this window
is conclusive proof of the humiliating fact that a large
number of the Americans who visit Stratford are ninnies.
I venture the assertion that their admiration for Shakespeare
is humbug, that they have not sufficient intelligence
to appreciate his real worth, and that they could stand
about as good an examination on the immortal plays as
that King George who, after vain attempts to read Shakespeare,
gave it up with the remark that it was very dull
stuff. He was "clever just like a donkey," as one of our
European guides said when we asked him about the intellectual
grade of certain monks, and these citizens of a
free country who give money for a monument to Charles I.
and Archbishop Laud are equally clever. I was speaking
of this window to one of the most interesting men I met
in Scotland, my host, the learned and distinguished Dr.
W. G. Blackie, and he put the whole thing into "the husk
o' a hazel" with the remark that "Charles the First was
one of the most incorrigible liars that ever lived." He
was, and he was moreover the inveterate foe of every
principle represented by the American Government. And
yet Americans are contributing to a memorial window of
him and Laud!</p>

<div class="sidenote">English in
England.</div>

<p>As one wanders about the streets of the
quaint English town he is beset from time
to time by groups of children, who in a kind of humming
or chanting chorus recite the leading facts in the life of
Shakespeare, for which they expect, of course, to receive
a small fee. The substance and sound of this curious
monotone have been represented approximately as follows:
"William Shykespeare, the gryte poet, was born in
Stratford-on-Avon in 1564&mdash;the 'ouse in which he dwelt
may still be seen&mdash;'is father in the gryte poet's boyhood
was 'igh bailiff of the plyce&mdash;one who shykes a spear
is the meaning of 'is nyme," and so on. In like manner
the London newsboys say, "Pipers, sir?" As a friend of
mine puts it, they do not "label your trunks" here, but
"libel your boxes," and they call the Tate Gallery "Tight."
That reminds me of the queer pronunciation of many
proper names in Great Britain. Of course you know that
Thames is pronounced Temz, and Greenwich Grinij, and
Beauchamp Beecham, and Gloucester Gloster, and
Brougham Broom. But did you know that Kirkcudbright
was pronounced Kirk-coó-bree, that at Cambridge
they call Caius College Keys College, and that at Oxford
they call Magdalen College Maudlen College? The Cockburn
Hotel at which we stopped in Edinburgh is called
Coburn. So Colquhoun is Cohoon, Wemyss is Weems,
Glamis is Glams, Charteris is Charters, Methuen is
Methven, Cholmondeley is Chumley, Marjoribanks is
Marchbanks, Ruthven is Riven, DeBelvoir is De Beever
and Menzies is Mingis. Worse yet, Bethune is Beeten,
Levison-Gower is Luson-Gore, Colclough is Coatley, St.
John is Sinjun, St. Leger is Silleger, and Uttoxeter is
Uxeter. But, then, we have in Virginia the name Enroughty
pronounced Darby. High Holborn in London is
'I 'Obun. Some of their contractions are remarkable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
The name of Bunhill Fields, the great Nonconformist
burying-ground, is short for Bone Hill. The famous
charity school, where the boys wear blue coats, is called
"The Blukkit School," instead of the Blue Coat School.
Rotten Row, the fashionable track for horseback riders
in Hyde Park, is an ugly contraction of the French words
<i>route de roi</i>, the king's road, because there was a time
when only the king was allowed to use it. I cannot leave
this subject without telling you that the name of Dugald
Dalgetty of Drumthwacket, who afforded you so much
amusement when you were reading <i>The Legend of
Montrose</i>, is called in Scotland Diggety instead of Dalgetty.</p>

<p>Other things of interest in this connection are that
shoes are not shoes in England, they are boots. If you
ask for shoes they will give you slippers. There are no
overshoes, only galoches. No shirtwaists, nothing but
blouses. You can't get a spool of thread, but a reel of
cotton. Locomotive engineers are called "drivers," and
conductors are called "guards." In Scotland all the
church notices are "intimations."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tom Brown's
School-days
at Rugby.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">One</span> would think at first view that it would be as easy
to write a good book for boys about school life as
to write a good story about any other subject. But it
does not seem to be so. At any rate, many gifted and
practised authors have attempted it, with
only moderate success. Archdeacon Farrar,
one of the most versatile writers of our
time, has given us a pretty good story of school life in
his <i>St. Winifred's</i>, but the work is marred by its too
constant appeal to morbid emotion. Mr. Rudyard Kipling,
too, has tried his hand on a book for boys, and has
only given us what Dr. Robertson Nicoll justly calls "that
detestable thing," <i>Stalky &amp; Co</i>. The less boys have to do
with that kind of books the better. High hopes were
raised by the announcement that the Rev. John Watson,
D. D., of Liverpool, better known as "Ian Maclaren,"
author of <i>Beside the Bonny Brier Bush</i>, and many other
exceedingly popular volumes, was to publish a book on
school-boy life. It was known that he had the requisite
talent, sympathy and humor, that he was a scholarly and
high-minded man, and that he had sons of his own.
Surely these are just the qualifications that a man ought
to have in order to write an ideal book for boys. But
Dr. Watson's book, <i>Young Barbarians</i>, was a disappointment.
It has many true and bright and laughable things
in it, and it glorifies manliness and pluck, but it often ridicules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the good boys of the school, the boys who give the
teacher no trouble and perform their tasks faithfully, and
it makes the most mischievous and lawless boy in school
its hero. Besides, it is not one continuous story, but a
group of sketches.</p>

<p>In short, I know only one book of this class having
the first order of merit, and that is <i>Tom Brown's School
Days at Rugby</i>. In my judgment, that is the best book
for boys that has yet been written, the most natural, the
most interesting, the most wholesome. It has an abiding
charm. I read it as a boy, and I have read it again and
again since I was grown. It is one of the books whose
scenes I have always wished to visit. The opportunity
came a few days ago while I was travelling through Central
England with several youngsters, ranging from eleven
years to fifteen, to whom I had read <i>Tom Brown</i>, and
who wished to visit Rugby.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Rugby
of to-day.</div>

<p>The place is now an important railway
junction, with a wilderness of tracks, and
trains flying in and out in every direction. What a
change in the mode of travel since the days of the Pig
and Whistle which brought Tom down to Rugby! The
school itself, however, is much the same&mdash;the venerable
buildings and quadrangles; the doctor's house, with its
wealth of vines; the wide sweep of green playground,
where Tom had his memorable first experience at football,
and "the island," as the mound on one side was
called. On the bulletin board was an announcement about
"hare and hounds," so that this splendid game, so finely
described in the book, is evidently still a favorite. One
marked innovation since Tom's time is the introduction
of the military feature into the school. The boys are
now regularly drilled, and in passing through the buildings
one sees the rows of rifles neatly ranged along the

walls. It is one of many indications of England's effort
to keep up a full stream of recruits for her army.</p>

<p>In the library we are shown the long gilt hand from
the old clock in the school tower, the very hand on which
Tom and East scratched their names as a suitable conclusion
to a certain series of exploits; and, looking closely,
we see the name "Thomas Hughes." He was the original
of Tom Brown, and to him we are indebted for this unrivalled
story of life at school. Just in front of the library
building stands a singularly fit and vital bronze statue of
Judge Hughes, represented as wearing a sack coat, informal,
manly, keenly intelligent, kind and true&mdash;the very
thing to appeal to boys.</p>

<p>I spoke above of the generally unchanged appearance
of the buildings. But the library just mentioned is an
exception, being new; and another exception is the very
large and handsome new chapel of variegated brick, so
that we no longer see it just as it was when Tom, on
revisiting Rugby, knelt before Dr. Arnold's tomb, and
lifted a subdued and thankful heart to God. But the
remains of the great head-master still lie there, and on
one side of the chapel is a good recumbent statue of
Arnold, and just below it a similar one of his favorite
pupil, Stanley, afterwards the celebrated dean of Westminster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our Expedition
to Tom
Brown's
Birthplace.</div>

<p>We left Rugby regretfully, but we were not
through with the scenes connected with
Tom Brown, by any means, for, a few days
later, while sojourning at Oxford, I proposed
one evening to our young people that we should
make an expedition to the White Horse Vale, where Tom
was born, and where, moreover, we could see that most
ancient, most striking, and most durable of Saxon monuments,
the huge figure of a galloping horse, three hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and seventy feet long, cut in the hillside by removing the
turf to the depth of a foot or two and exposing the white
chalk beneath, made by King Alfred's soldiers to commemorate
his great victory over the Danes at this place&mdash;to
say nothing of a great fortified Roman camp on top
of the same hill. The suggestion was agreed to with
alacrity, and next morning, after an early breakfast, we
took a train from Oxford down the Thames Valley, but
at Didcot turned westward, and soon came to Wantage,
the birthplace of Alfred the Great, of whom there is a
statue in the marketplace, the native town also of Bishop
Butler, the author of the immortal <i>Analogy</i>, and the residence
at present of the notorious leader of Tammany
Hall, New York, Richard Croker, who has his racing
stables here.</p>

<p>The country through which we are passing is as flat
as a Western prairie, but since leaving Didcot we have
come in sight of a range of chalk hills covered with the
greenest of grass, running parallel with the railway on
our left, and distant some two or three miles. The highest
point in this range is the White Horse Hill&mdash;our
destination.</p>

<p>At Uffington Station we leave the train and begin our
tramp, first of two miles to Uffington village, where, as
we pass the parish school, we have the good fortune to
see the children all out at play, as in the time when Harry
Winburn taught Tom Brown that valuable trick in wrestling,
and when Tom and Jacob Doodlecalf were caught
by the wheelwright while performing in the porch in a
manner not conducive to the gravity and order of the
school.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Highest
Horse we ever
Mounted.</div>

<p>The ground has been level thus far, but for
the next mile or so it rises gently, the great
white figure on the hill before us becoming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
more distinct as we come around in front of it
somewhat, and then when we come to the foot of
the hill itself we find a sharp climb before us, and are
presently going almost straight up. Up, up we go. Let
us pause for a rest. Up again. Another pause. Now
look back. What a lovely view! One more pull for the
top, and here we are at last, standing on the broad tail
of the White Horse, mopping our brows with our handkerchiefs,
and panting with the exertion, while the wind
blows a stiff gale from the west. But we yield the floor
for a few moments to the man who first told us about
this place:</p>

<p>What a hill is the White Horse Hill! There it stands
right up above all the rest, nine hundred feet above the
sea, the boldest, bravest shape for a chalk hill that you
ever saw. Let us go up to the top of him, and see what
is to be found there. Ay, you may well wonder and
think it odd you never heard of this before....</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Roman
Camp.</div>

<p>Yes, it's a magnificent Roman camp, and no
mistake, with gates and ditch and mounds,
all as complete as it was twenty years after the strong
old rogues had left it. Here, right up on the highest point,
from which they say you can see eleven counties, they
trenched round all the tableland, some twelve or fourteen
acres, as was their custom, for they couldn't bear anybody
to overlook them, and made their eyrie. The ground falls
away rapidly on all sides. Was there ever such turf in
the whole world? You sink up to your ankles at every
step, and yet the spring of it is delicious. There is always
a breeze in the "camp," as it is called; and here it lies,
just as the Romans left it.... It is altogether a place
that you won't forget,&mdash;a place to open a man's soul and
make him prophesy, as he looks down on that great vale
spread out as the garden of the Lord before him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
wave on wave of the mysterious downs behind; and to
the right and left the chalk hills running away into the
distance, along which he can trace for miles the old
Roman road, "the Ridgeway" ("the Rudge," as the country
folk call it), keeping straight along the highest back
of the hills;&mdash;such a place as Balak brought Balaam to
and told him to prophesy against the people in the valley
beneath. And he could not, neither shall you, for they
are a people of the Lord who abide there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">King Alfred's
Defeat of
the Danes.</div>

<p>And now we leave the camp, and descend
towards the west and are on the Ash-down.
We are treading on heroes. For this is the
actual place where our Alfred won his great battle, the
battle of Ash-down, which broke the Danish power, and
made England a Christian land. The Danes held the
camp and the slope where we are standing&mdash;the whole
crown of the hill, in fact. "The heathen had beforehand
seized the higher ground," as old Asser says, having
wasted everything behind them from London, and being
just ready to burst down on the fair Vale, Alfred's own
birthplace and heritage. And up the heights came the
Saxons, "and there the battle was joined with a mighty
shout, and the pagans were defeated with great slaughter."
After which crowning mercy the pious king, that there
might never be wanting a sign and a memorial to the
countryside, carved out on the northern side of the chalk
hill, under the camp, where it is almost precipitous, the
great Saxon white horse, which he who will may see from
the railway, and which gives its name to the vale, over
which it has looked these thousand years and more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Manger
and the
Dragon's Hill.</div>

<p>Right down below the White Horse is a
curious deep and broad gully, called "the
manger" [because it is right under the
mouth of the White Horse], into one side of which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
hills fall with a series of the most lovely sweeping curves,
known as "the Giant's Stairs"; they are not a bit like
stairs, but I never saw anything like them anywhere else,
with their short, green turf, and tender bluebells, and
gossamer and thistle-down gleaming in the sun, and the
sheep paths running along their sides like ruled lines.</p>

<p>The other side of the Manger is formed by the
Dragon's Hill, a curious little round self-confident fellow,
thrown forward from the range, utterly unlike everything
round him. On this hill some deliverer of mankind&mdash;St.
George, the country folk used to tell me&mdash;killed a
dragon. Whether it were St. George I cannot say; but
surely a dragon was killed there, for you may see the
marks yet where his blood ran down, and more by token
the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the
hillside. So far Thomas Hughes.</p>

<p>As a truthful chronicler, I must record that some of
our party, tempted by the precipitous slope covered with
luxuriant grass, slid down the hill from the White Horse
into the Manger, sitting down on the turf and letting
themselves go, with the result of wrecking a pair of
trousers or so, and carrying away some portion of the
fertile soil of Berks to Oxford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blowing
Stone.</div>

<p>Passing along the ridgeway to the west for
about a mile, we may come to Wayland
Smith's forge, a cave familiar to readers of <i>Kenilworth</i>,
but we content ourselves with a distant view, and, descending
the hill, turn to the east, and, after a brisk walk
of three or four miles, we halt under a fine old tree in
front of a cottage door, to see another object described
in <i>Tom Brown's School Days at Rugby</i>, the celebrated
Blowing Stone, "a square lump of stone, some three feet
and a half high, perforated with two or three queer holes,
like petrified antediluvian rat holes." It is chained to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
tree and secured with a padlock. Instead of the innkeeper,
for whom Mr. Hughes was so fearful lest he should burst
or have apoplexy when he blew the stone, a very comely
matron came out of the cottage and blew it for us&mdash;then
we all blew it in turn. The sound is described exactly
in the book: "a grewsome sound, between a moan and
a roar, spreads itself away over the valley, and up the
hillside, and into the woods at the back of the house, a
ghost-like, awful voice." This stone is said to have been
used in old times to give warning and summons in time
of war.</p>

<p>In his other book, on <i>The Scouring of the White Horse</i>,
that is, the scraping away of the accumulated sand and
grass, which is the occasion every year for the gathering
of the whole countryside for games and festivities, Judge
Hughes gives the following ballad in the country dialect,
which contains a reference to this use of the stone:</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Effect
upon our
Appetite.</div>

<p>But the sun is now sinking westward, and
we have still a long walk before us to the
railroad, and in order to catch our train it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
must be a rapid walk as well. We have been so much
interested that we did not think of anything to eat until
now, but the vigorous exercise has given us keen appetites,
and we begin to inquire for food. None to be had. So
we set out hungry on our forced march to the station,
and by steady toil reach it a few minutes before the arrival
of our train, having tramped thirteen long miles up hill
and down dale since leaving the train there that morning.
In the compartment which we entered were a couple of
English ladies, who presently opened a small case of tea
things, lighted a spirit lamp, and brewed their tea. Then
<i>they</i> drank it. That was the best tea I ever&mdash;smelled.
The delicious aroma of it tantalized and tormented our
weary and hungry pedestrians for miles, and put an edge
on our appetites that made obedience to the tenth commandment
an utter impossibility.</p>

<p>It may seem incredible, but it is a fact that our friend,
Mr. Bird, and two of the youngsters in the party, did
four miles more on foot at Wantage later on in the same
day. You may be sure there was hearty eating and sound
sleeping when we all got back to our quarters at Oxford
that night, well satisfied with our memorable visit to the
White Horse and the Blowing Stone.</p>

<p>Our sojourn at Oxford, with her wealth of mellow
architecture and her inspiring historical and literary associations,&mdash;our
visits to Windsor Castle, Eton College, and
Stoke Pogis, where Gray wrote his immortal "Elegy,"&mdash;and
our excursions to Hampton Court, with its wonderful
grape vine and its crowding memories of Wolsey, Cromwell,
and William III., and to Kingston, Richmond Hill,
Kew Gardens, Kensington and the Crystal Palace,&mdash;were
all full of interest, but must be passed over here, as there
are subjects of greater importance connected with London
which will occupy all the remaining space that we can
give to England.</p>

<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>October 2, 1902</i>.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Birthplace
of the Shorter
Catechism.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Some</span> months ago, when the kind urgency of my
friends made it plain to me that I should go abroad
for a while, and when it was decided that certain young
students of the Shorter Catechism in my family should
go with me, I promised them a visit to the
birthplace of that marvellous compendium
of biblical doctrine, which for two hundred
and fifty years has been such a weariness to the flesh of
Presbyterian children throughout the English-speaking
world, especially on Sunday afternoons, and which is such
a priceless possession of their adult years when once
thoroughly acquired in youth; but I told them that the
condition on which alone I could take them with a clear
conscience to the spot where that matchless little book
was written, was that they should memorize it perfectly
beforehand, and I had the satisfaction before leaving home
of hearing them all recite it without a mistake; and, in
order to retain with ease what was thus acquired with toil,
they have continued to recite it regularly from beginning
to end every Sunday afternoon. This is, of course, nothing
more than hundreds of other children have done,
and I do not mention it as anything remarkable, but only
as suggesting one reason for the eager interest with which
we were looking forward to our visit to a certain part of
Westminster Abbey. And so, on the very first morning
after our first arrival in London, as soon as we had finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
breakfast, we hurried down to the gray old minster,
where, in the midst of the roaring city, so many of the
restless makers of the world's history, literature and art
are now quietly sleeping; for we intended, after seeing
where the Westminster Assembly sat, to give a full morning
to the other historical memorials of the Abbey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Coronation
Postponed.</div>

<p>Imagine, then, our disappointment, on
reaching the place, to find the Abbey closed,
and to learn from the policeman at the door that no one
knew when it would be opened again, certainly not for
several weeks. You see, the building had been elaborately
decorated for the coronation of King Edward VII.,
for this is where all the Kings of England have been
crowned, from the time of William the Conqueror down;
and while we were crossing the ocean King Edward became
very ill and had to undergo a surgical operation,
as we learned on landing at Southampton, and so the
great ceremonies planned for June 26th had to be postponed.
But the costly draperies used in the decorations
were still in position, and had to remain till it should be
seen whether the King would be well enough in a few
weeks to receive the crown; and of course the public
could not be admitted to the Abbey till these sumptuous
fabrics had either served their original purpose or been
removed. Happily the King did recover in a few weeks,
to the great joy of his subjects, who, chastened and subdued
by their sovereign's sickness at a time so critical,
came to the coronation on the second date appointed,
August 9th, in a more thankful, if less jubilant, temper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Abbey
still Closed.</div>

<p>Meantime, however, we had gone on to
Scotland, after three weeks in London, feeling
sure that on our return there would be nothing to
prevent our seeing the great Abbey to our hearts' content.
But no; after two full months in Edinburgh and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Scottish Highlands and the west of England, we found
the Abbey still closed. The work of removing the temporary
structures and hangings used at the coronation
was still going on, a fact which suggests forcibly the extent
of these preparations, and, perhaps, also the leisureliness
of English workmen, who are probably not accustomed
to doing things as rapidly as Americans. But we
had no idea of being deprived altogether of a sight of the
interior of the Abbey by their slowness. London is a
place of endless interest to visitors; and so, though we
had already given three weeks to the principal sights of
the city, we contentedly settled down for two weeks more
there, till the work in the Abbey should be finished. At
last it was all done, and on October 1st the building was
again opened. We were among the first on the ground,
and gave two full days to as thorough an examination
of the building and its unparalleled contents as was practicable
within that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Assembly
of Divines.</div>

<p>Of this inspection of the Abbey and its
monuments in general we shall have something
to say after a while, but for the present let us
turn our attention to those parts of the building which
are associated with the work of the famous Assembly
of ministers and other scholars who met here in 1643 by
ordinance of Parliament "to establish a new platform of
worship and discipline to this nation for all time to come,"
and to whose pious and learned labors, extending through
more than five years and a half, and occupying one thousand
one hundred and sixty-three sessions, the world is
indebted for the Larger and Shorter Catechisms and that
great Confession of Faith "which, alone within these
islands, was imposed by law on the whole kingdom," and
which, by its fidelity to Scripture, its logical coherence,
and the majesty and fervor of its style, still commands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the adherence of a multitude of the clearest and strongest
minds in Christendom.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Two Places
of Meeting.</div>

<p>The two parts of the Abbey especially connected
with the work of the Assembly are
at the two opposite ends of the building: the Chapel of
Henry VII. at the eastern end, and the Jerusalem Chamber
at the western; the one the most beautiful chapel in
the world, the other a plain but comfortable rectangular
room. Immediately after the service with which the
Assembly was opened, and in which both houses of Parliament
took part, and which was probably held in the
choir of the Abbey, where the regular daily services now
take place, the members appointed to the Assembly
ascended the steps to the Chapel of Henry VII., and there
the enrollment was made and the earlier sessions held.
That was in summer, but when the weather became colder
the Assembly gladly forsook the architectural magnificence
of this chapel, called by Leland "the miracle of the
world," for the comfortable warmth of the homely room
at the other end of the Abbey; for, as Robert Baillie,
"the Boswell of the Assembly," says in his delightful account
of the proceedings, the Jerusalem Chamber "has a
good fyre, which is some dainties at London."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Two Types
of Worship.</div>

<p>In this removal of the historic Assembly
from the cold splendor of the finest perpendicular
building in England to the plain comfort and
common-sense arrangements of the little rectangular room
where they were to reason together through so many
months concerning the teachings of Scripture, one may
see a parable of the Assembly's action in rejecting the
ritualistic type of worship, with its predominating appeal
to the æsthetic sensibilities through elaborate ceremonies,
and its adoption of the New Testament type, with its
predominating appeal to the mind through the oral teaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of truth. They were convinced that the spiritual life
can be really nourished and developed only by the intelligent
apprehension of the truth. Their own statement of
the matter, drawn up in this very room, is that "the Spirit
of God maketh the reading, but especially the preaching
of the Word, an effectual means of convincing and converting
sinners, and of building them up in holiness and
comfort, through faith unto salvation." And so those
churches which have adopted the standards then framed
by the Westminster divines have steadily magnified the
didactic element of public worship, accentuating the teaching
function of the minister to the extinction of the
priestly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interior of the
Jerusalem
Chamber.</div>

<p>We pass from the nave of the Abbey
through a door on the south side into the
ancient cloisters, and, turning to the right,
ring at the door of the janitor. A cherry-cheeked woman
appears, and, when we state that we wish to see the Jerusalem
Chamber, she brings a key, turns with us again
to the right, which brings us to the southwest corner of
the Abbey, and ushers us through an ante-room into the
celebrated meeting-place of the great Assembly, a rectangular
room, running north and south, about forty feet in
length by twenty in breadth, with a large double window
in the western side opposite the spacious fireplace referred
to by Baillie, and another fine window in the northern
end, which, by the way, contains the finest stained glass
in the whole Abbey.</p>

<p>A long table, covered with a plain green cloth, occupies
the centre of the room, with chairs around it ready for
convocation; for the room is still regularly used for the
meetings of ecclesiastical functionaries, occasionally also
for special gatherings of wider interest, the most notable
of which, since the Westminster Assembly, was the series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
of sessions held here by the company of scholars who
had been appointed to revise the common English version
of the Scriptures, and who, in 1885, brought that immensely
difficult and important work to a successful conclusion
by their publication of the Revised Version of the
Old Testament.</p>

<p>This room has been the scene of many other memorable
events, as we shall presently see, but none of them,
nor all of them, can equal in interest and importance the
work of that great Assembly which two hundred and fifty
years ago formulated that lofty ideal of human life so
familiar to us in the answer to the first question of the
Shorter Catechism: What is the chief end of man?
Man's chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy him forever&mdash;a
statement which has probably had a deeper and
wider influence for good in the Anglo-Saxon world than
any other twelve words ever written by uninspired men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exterior of the
Jerusalem
Chamber.</div>

<p>The Jerusalem Chamber, in which the
Westminster Assembly of divines held its
long sessions and did its immortal work, is
a low building which runs along the southern half of the
front of the Abbey, and is easily seen to the right of the
main door in any picture of the great western facade. It
strikes one at first as an architectural blunder, except as
a foil to the lofty front of the main structure, but it has
served many great practical uses. It was built about five
hundred years ago, in the old days of monastery, as a
guest chamber for the Abbot's house. I may pause here
a moment to remind my younger readers of the fact that
the word "minster," as in "Westminster," is equivalent
to monastery, from the Latin <i>monasterium</i>, and the still
more curious fact that the word has been preserved more
nearly in its Latin form in the Monster Tavern and the
Monster Omnibuses, well known in the immediate neighborhood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
of the Abbey, which derive their name from the
same ancient monastery now known as Westminster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Origin of
its Name.</div>

<p>The name, Jerusalem Chamber, seems to
have been derived from the tapestries with
which the walls were originally hung, and which portrayed
different scenes in the history of Jerusalem. Before
the meeting of the Westminster Assembly, however, these
had been replaced by another series of pictures representing
the planets, and it is to these that Baillie refers when
he tells us that the room was "well hung." To the same
keen observer, whom nothing escaped, we are indebted
for the information that the light from the great window
was softened by "curtains of pale thread with red roses."
But the curtains and tapestries that Baillie saw have in
turn given place to those which the visitor now sees on
the walls, and which do not call for special notice here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death of
Henry IV.</div>

<p>The first tapestries, however, those which gave the room
its name, are connected with one of the most memorable
events that ever occurred in this historic apartment, the
death of Henry IV., in fulfillment, as the
King thought, of the prophecy that he
should die in Jerusalem. In his old age Henry projected
a visit to the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem, by way of
penance for his usurpation, and when the galleys were
already in port to bear him on his journey, he came to
pay his parting devotions at the shrine of Edward the
Confessor in Westminster Abbey. There he was seized
with a chill, and, as the old chronicler says, "became so
sick that such as were about him feared that he would
have died right there; wherefore they, for his comfort,
bare him into the Abbot's place, and lodged him in a
chamber, and there upon a pallet laid him before the fire,
where he lay in great agony a certain time." When
borne to the bed, which had meantime been prepared for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
him in another room, the scene occurred which is so
graphically described by Shakespeare:</p>

    <div class="verse">In that Jerusalem shall Harry die."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Imprisonment of
Sir Thomas
More.</div>

<p>But Henry IV. was not the only man who
looked death in the face in this room. Many
years later, when Henry VIII. was just beginning
that infamous career of divorcing and beheading
wives, and burning Protestants as heretics, and hanging
Romanists as traitors for saying that the Pope was superior
to the King in matters of religion&mdash;a career which
has made his name one of the most detestable in history&mdash;Sir
Thomas More, the noblest Englishman of his time,
was arrested for his refusal to swear that Henry's marriage
with Anne Boleyn was lawful, and on his way to
the Tower of London was confined for four days in the
Jerusalem Chamber. Shortly afterwards, under the act
of Parliament which directed that every one who refused
to give the King a title belonging to him was to be put
to death as a traitor, Sir Thomas More was executed on
Tower Hill because he could not honestly give Henry the
title of Supreme Head of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Other dead bodies, too, besides that of Henry IV. have
lain in this room. The body of Dr. South, the witty and
eloquent court preacher, lay in state here. It was South
who, when reading from the seventeenth chapter of the
Acts the accusation of the Thessalonian mob against Paul
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
and Silas&mdash;"These that have turned the world upside
down are come hither also"&mdash;remarked that it was well
for the apostles to turn the world upside down, because
the devil had turned it downside up.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Funeral of
Joseph
Addison.</div>

<p>From the Jerusalem Chamber the body of
the illustrious essayist, Joseph Addison,
after lying in state for four days, was carried
forth in that memorable funeral procession at dead
of night which was led by torchlight round the shrine
of St. Edward and the graves of the Plantagenets to the
chapel of Henry VII., the body being finally laid to rest
opposite the Poet's Corner in the South Transept. "Such
a mark of national respect was due to the unsullied statesman,
to the accomplished scholar, to the master of pure
English eloquence, to the consummate painter of life and
manners. It was due, above all, to the great satirist, who
alone knew how to use ridicule without abusing it; who,
without inflicting a wound, effected a great social reform,
and who reconciled wit and virtue, after a long and disastrous
separation, during which wit had been led astray
by profligacy, and virtue by fanaticism." So wrote Lord
Macaulay of Addison, reminding us, at the same time,
how Addison "was accustomed to walk by himself in
Westminster Abbey, and meditate on the condition of
those who lay in it"; and now Macaulay himself lies there
close to the grave of Addison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir Isaac
Newton.</div>

<p>But the most illustrious man whose body
has ever lain in state in the Jerusalem Chamber
is Sir Isaac Newton, the great philosopher, whom his
friends called "the whitest soul they had ever known,"
and of whom Pope wrote the celebrated couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;</div>
    <div class="verse">God said, <i>Let Newton be</i>, and all was light."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>Such are some of the great names associated with the
Jerusalem Chamber&mdash;Henry IV., Thomas More, Robert
South, Joseph Addison, Isaac Newton&mdash;and to some of
them the whole world is indebted, as to Sir Thomas More
for his calm refusal to purchase his life at the cost of his
convictions, and to Joseph Addison for all that he was
as an author, a man, and a Christian, and to Sir Isaac
Newton for his lofty character and his unparalleled services
to the cause of human knowledge; but, after all, it
may be doubted whether the world is more deeply indebted
to any of them than to that body of thoroughgoing
scholars and profound thinkers who in this room two
centuries and a half ago formulated the statement that
"effectual calling is the work of God's Spirit, whereby,
convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our
minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing our wills,
he doth persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ,
freely offered to us in the gospel"&mdash;and one hundred and
six other propositions concerning the most momentous
interests of human existence, which for luminous condensation
of truth have never been surpassed in all the
history of the human expression of the doctrines of Scripture.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Architectural
Triumph.</div>

<p>Westminster Abbey is not wanting in architectural
interest. Indeed, it is pronounced
by Mr. Freeman the most glorious of English churches,
and is said to be the one great church of England which
retains its beautiful ancient coloring undestroyed by so-called
"restoration." The exterior is singularly impressive,
whether viewed from the east, where the exquisite
lacework of Henry VII.'s Chapel, with its richly decorated
buttresses, rivets the attention at the first glance; or from
the north, where we face the north transept, the front of
which, with its niches, its rose-window, and its great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
triple entrance, is pronounced by Mr. Hare the richest
part of the building externally; or even from the west,
where, in spite of the two comparatively late and feeble
towers, we have a noble front, the loftiness of which is
well brought out by "the low line of grey wall which
indicates the Jerusalem Chamber." The interior is still
more beautiful, and, as we have already seen, this beauty
culminates in Henry VII.'s Chapel, the loveliness of which
is absolutely unrivalled in the whole world. In his very
sympathetic essay on Westminster Abbey in <i>The Sketch
Book</i>, Washington Irving says of this wonderful chapel:
"On entering, the eye is astonished by the pomp of architecture
and the elaborate beauty of sculptured detail. The
very walls are wrought into universal ornament, incrusted
with tracery, and scooped into niches, crowded with the
statues of saints and martyrs. Stone seems, by the cunning
labor of the chisel, to have been robbed of its weight
and density, suspended aloft, as if by magic, and the
fretted roof achieved with the wonderful minuteness and
airy security of a cobweb."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coronations
and Burials.</div>

<p>But the intrinsic beauty of the building is
only a small part of the explanation of the
unique place which it holds in the interest of mankind.
The two real reasons are suggested by Waller's lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent2">"That antique pile behold,</div>
    <div class="verse">Where royal heads receive the sacred gold:</div>
    <div class="verse">It gives them crowns, and does their ashes keep;</div>
    <div class="verse">There made like gods, like mortals there they sleep,</div>
    <div class="verse">Making the circle of their reign complete,</div>
    <div class="verse">Those suns of empire, where they rise they set."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Coronation and burial! Here the nominal kings are
crowned. Here they and the real kings&mdash;those who by
their genius and character really rule the race&mdash;are
buried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Stone
of Scone.</div>

<p>In the chapel of Edward the Confessor
stands a scratched and battered wooden
chair, six hundred years old, beneath the seat of which
is inserted a thick, flat block of reddish sandstone. This
is the celebrated Stone of Destiny, about the adventures
and travels of which so many incredible stories have been
told, from the time of its alleged use by the patriarch
Jacob as a pillar at Bethel, till the time of its arrival at
Scone, near Perth, in Scotland. It is certain that from
the middle of the twelfth century all the Scottish kings
were crowned on this stone, till it was captured and carried
to London by Edward I., and that in the oak chair
beneath which the stone was then enclosed all the kings
of England since the time of Edward I. have been
crowned, the last being Edward VII., on the 9th of last
August. It has never been carried out of the church but
once. That was when it was taken to Westminster Hall,
across the street, that in it Oliver Cromwell might be
installed Lord Protector. Thus it was that "the greatest
prince that ever ruled England," as Lord Macaulay rightly
calls him, the man who refused to wear the crown, but
who wielded so much more of real power than any of
those who did wear it that he placed England in the forefront
of European nations and made her mistress of the
seas, was not inducted into his office in the Abbey, where
all the other sovereigns have been crowned since William
I., but in Westminster Hall, which is also a place
of extraordinary historical interest. The chair which
holds the Stone of Scone, and the mate to it, made later
and used for the queen consort, are, of course, covered
with rich upholstering at the coronations, and much of
the defacement of them is the result of driving nails into
the wood for this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Whither the
Paths of
Glory Lead.</div>

<p>But the main attraction of Westminster
Abbey is neither its architectural glory nor
its connection with the crowning of the
nation's sovereigns, but the fact that it is the chief sepulchre
of Britain's great men. Not only is the building
"paved with princes and a royal race," their memory a
mingling of grandeur and of shame, but the uncrowned
glories of the nation, the true and pure and gifted, lie
there as well under our feet, or are commemorated in
stone before our eyes. Some English sovereigns are
buried elsewhere, as Charles I. at Windsor, and Victoria
at Frogmore; some preëminent men of action also, as
Nelson and Wellington at St. Paul's Cathedral; some
authors, too, of the first order of genius, as Shakespeare
at Stratford, Milton at St. Giles, and Goldsmith in the
Temple yard at London; and so on, but nowhere else on
earth have the ashes of so many great men been brought
together as in Westminster Abbey. Moreover, to many
who are buried elsewhere monuments have been erected in
the Abbey; for instance, to the three poets who have just
been mentioned. That of Shakespeare is a marble figure
holding a scroll on which are inscribed these lines from
the <i>Tempest</i>, peculiarly appropriate in the building where
so much greatness is buried:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent-1">"The Cloud capt Towers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1">The Gorgeous Palaces,</div>

    <div class="verse indent-1">The Great Globe itself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1">Yea all which it Inherit,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shall Dissolve,</div>
    <div class="verse">And like the baseless Fabrick of a Vision</div>
    <div class="verse indent-1">Leave not a rack behind."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In St. Margaret's Church, hard by the Abbey on the
north side, lies the decapitated body of another great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Englishman of the Elizabethan era, Sir Walter Raleigh,
whose <i>History of the World</i> contains a passage which
expresses, as no other within my knowledge has done,
the feeling that comes to a thoughtful man as he walks
through this solemn burial place of genius and power:
"O eloquent, just, and mighty Death! whom none could
advise, thou hast persuaded; what none hath dared, thou
hast done; and whom all the world hath flattered, thou
only hast cast out of the world and despised; thou hast
drawn together all the far-stretched greatness, all the
pride, cruelty, and ambition of man, and covered it all
over with these two words, <i>Hic jacet</i>."</p>

<p>A sober autumn day, with the leaves changing and the
atmosphere touched with melancholy suggestive of the
passing of worldly glory, prepared us to feel the full
force of Raleigh's sentiment, and, as we stepped through
the doorway into the subdued light of the minster, and
saw the multitude of white marble statues and tombs
stretching through dim aisles and clustering in gloomy
chapels, we were "hushed into noiseless reverence," and
understood what Edmund Burke meant when he said,
"The moment I entered Westminster Abbey, I felt a kind
of awe pervade my mind which I cannot describe; the
very silence seemed sacred."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Monuments
of the Nave
and Transepts.</div>

<p>Remembering that "too many tombs will
produce the same satiety as too many pictures,"
and determined not to fill our minds
with "a hopeless jumble in which kings and statesmen,
warriors, ecclesiastics and poets are tossing about together,"
we began at the Poet's Corner, as every one
should do on his first visit, and, merely glancing at the
monuments of subordinate interest, gave our time to those
of the men with whose lives and works we had some
acquaintance from our former reading, thus spending a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
whole morning in the two transepts and the nave. What
a list of glorious names is afforded by even this meagre
selection! Chaucer, Spencer, Browning, Tennyson,
Shakespeare, Milton, Gray, Burns, Scott, Goldsmith, Coleridge,
Southey (the last eight named being represented by
monuments, but buried elsewhere); Thackeray, Addison,
Macaulay, Garrick, Samuel Johnson (with his degree of
LL. D. chiselled after his name in the unscholarly form
of "L. L. D."&mdash;a thing which would have mortified him,
and which one would not expect to find in Westminster
Abbey), Charles Dickens; Dr. Busby (for fifty-five years
head-master of Westminster School, celebrated for his
extremely free use of the rod and for having persistently
kept his hat on when Charles II. visited his school, saying
that it would never do for the boys to think any one
superior to himself);&mdash;all these and many more in or
near the south transept; then in the nave, Major André
(hanged by Washington as a spy), Lord Lawrence ("who
feared man so little because he feared God so much"),
David Livingstone, Charles Darwin, Sir Isaac Newton,
Matthew Arnold, Charles Kingsley, Wordsworth, William
Pitt, Charles James Fox, "Rare Ben Jonson"; then,
in the north transept, Lord Mansfield, Warren Hastings,
and others, among them the monument of the "Loyall
Duke of Newcastle" (1676) and his literary wife, a most
voluminous writer, who was in the habit of calling up
her servants at all hours of the night to take down her
thoughts, much to the disgust of her husband. When
complimented on her learning, he said, "Sir, a very wise
woman is a very foolish thing."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pagan Sculptures
in a
Christian
Church.</div>

<p>A great deal of bad taste has been displayed
in the monuments of this transept. There
is a colossal tomb by Nollekens, the worst
but one in the Abbey, commemorating three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
sea captains. It represents Neptune reclining on the back
of a sea-horse, and directing the attention of Britannia
to the medallions of the dead, which hang from a rostral
column surmounted by a figure of Victory. "Is that
Christianity?" asked a visitor, pointing to Neptune and
the trident. "Yes," wittily answered Dean Milman, "it
is <i>Tridentine</i> Christianity"&mdash;a remark which has an exceedingly
keen edge, though it may not be appreciated
except by those who have some knowledge of the relation
sustained by the Council of Trent to the beliefs and practices
of the Romish Church. The sculptors were for a
time "weighed down by the pagan mania for Neptunes,
Britannias, and Victorys." Goldwin Smith says, "Some
of the monuments might with advantage be removed from
a Christian Church to a heathen Pantheon, while some
might be better for being macadamized."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Nightingale
Monuments.</div>

<p>The most striking monument in the Abbey,
though Walpole calls it "more theatrical
than sepulchral," is that of Lady Elizabeth Nightingale.
In the lower part of the sculpture a skeleton figure, Death,
has broken through the iron doors of the grave, and,
grasping the ledge above him with one bony hand, is in
the act of hurling his dart with the other at the lady, who
with her husband occupies the upper part of the sculpture,
and who is represented as falling back into the arms of
her horror-stricken husband, while he makes frantic but
futile efforts to shield her from the stroke. Wesley said
Mrs. Nightingale's tomb was the finest in the Abbey, as
showing "common sense among heaps of unmeaning
stone and marble"; but Washington Irving, while granting
that the whole group is executed with terrible truth
and spirit, says it appears to him horrible rather than
sublime, and asks, "Why should we thus seek to clothe
death with unnecessary terrors, and to spread horrors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
round the tomb of those we love? The grave should be
surrounded by everything that might inspire tenderness
and veneration for the dead; or that might win the living
to virtue. It is the place, not of disgust and dismay, but
of sorrow and meditation."</p>

</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Hard-hearted
Verger.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> had reserved our last day in London for a visit
to the eastern part of the great Abbey, where
nearly all the kings and queens of England are buried.
There is a charge of sixpence for admission to this part
of the building. When we had paid our
fees a black robed, bullet-headed, hard-voiced
verger led us rapidly, along with a big crowd
of other sightseers, from one chapel to another, pointing
out one or two objects of special interest in each,
and speaking a few words of explanation. Thus we were
"railroaded" through the Royal Chapels in the most tantalizing
manner. When we were all turned out of the
iron gate at the end of this rapid round, with our heads
full of a jumble of kings and queens, and other notables,
our little party lingered to parley with our burly conductor,
in the hope of getting more time in this fascinating
part of the Abbey; but, though a shilling is a wonder-worker
in England, and though we offered to pay another
fee each for the privilege of remaining a while longer,
our guide was for some reason obdurate. It should be
added, in justice to him, that this was only the second
day that the Abbey had been opened to visitors, after
being closed throughout the greater part of the summer
on account of the coronation, and consequently there was
a much larger number of visitors for the vergers to handle
than usual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Courteous
Sub-Dean.</div>

<p>We were not yet beaten, however. After a
brief "council of war," two of us walked out
through the cloisters, rang at the door of the sub-Dean's
residence, and, learning that he was not in, left a note
for him, explaining our disappointment at having waited
so long for the Abbey to open, only to find that we could
get but a hasty glance at some of its most interesting
parts, and asking him to give us permission to visit those
parts at our leisure. On his return home, the sub-Dean,
Canon Duckworth, very courteously wrote the desired
authorization that we should visit the chapels "without a
guide," and this permission was of use to some members
of the party that afternoon.</p>

<p>Meantime it occurred to us that all vergers might not
be equally ungracious, so, pending the Canon's answer
to our note, we approached that one of the vergers who
seemed to have the most benevolent face, informed him
that we had just been through the chapels, but that our
guide had given us very little time, and had not shown
us the wax effigies at all, which we were very anxious
to see, and asked him if he could not afford us a better
opportunity. Unlike him of the stony heart into whose
hands we had fallen at first, this one promptly and kindly
granted our request, though doubtless expecting a fee,
which, by the way, he deserved and received, and not only
came with us himself to show us the wax effigies, but then
gave us liberty to roam among the chapels at our pleasure.
It was now dinner-time, but we gladly did without dinner
in order to improve the opportunity thus secured, and
set about a leisurely and thorough examination of the contents
of the chapels and adjoining rooms in the eastern
half of the building.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wax
Effigies.</div>

<p>The wax work figures in a chamber over
one of the chapels are very interesting, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
should not be missed by visitors to Westminster, and yet
I went through the Abbey some years ago without even
knowing that they were there. We had a good look at
them this time. They are effigies of notable personages,
dressed exactly as they were in life. These effigies were
carried at the public funerals of those whom they represent.
The earlier custom was to carry the embalmed
bodies of the kings and queens, with faces uncovered, at
their funerals, but from the time of Henry V. these life-like
representations were carried instead. Here is Queen
Elizabeth, ugly and overdressed, as usual, with the diadem
on her head, the huge ruff round her neck, the long
stomacher covered with jewels, the velvet robe embroidered
with gold and supported on panniers, and the pointed
high-heeled shoes with rosettes&mdash;"gotten up," perhaps,
pretty much as she was when, just a year before her death,
she had allowed the Scottish ambassador, as if by accident,
to see her "dancing high and disposedly," that he might
disappoint the hopes of his master, King James, by his
report of her health and spirits; she was then an old
woman. There are few subjects more perilous for a man
to write about than a woman's dress, and I may as well
tell my readers that in the foregoing description of Elizabeth's
finery I have closely followed good authorities.</p>

<p>Another of the effigies shows us the swarthy and sensual
face of Charles II. He is dressed in red velvet, with
lace collar and ruffles. Here, too, is the strong face and
slight figure of William III., represented as very much
shorter than Mary, his wife, who stands nearly six feet
in height beside him. The fat figure of Queen Anne, and
the very small one of Lord Nelson, with the empty sleeve
of course, are among the most interesting. There are
eleven in all still existing. A good many have disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Mutilated
Monuments.</div>

<p>The shrine of Edward the Confessor is
raised upon a kind of platform mound, said
to have been made of several shiploads of earth brought
from the Holy Land, and is surrounded by the tombs
of Edward I., the good Queen Eleanor, Richard II.,
Henry V., and others. Above the grand tomb of Henry V.
are hung his shield, saddle and helmet. Upon it lies the
headless effigy of the great king, which was cut from
English oak and plated with silver-gilt. The head, which
was of solid silver, with teeth of gold, was stolen from
the Abbey centuries ago. Other tombs have suffered in
the same way. The coffin of Edward the Confessor has
been robbed of its funeral ornaments. The sceptre has
been stolen from the hand of Queen Elizabeth. One of
the beautifully modelled fingers of the recumbent marble
statue of Mary, Queen of Scots, has been broken off,
carried away as a souvenir, perhaps, by some conscienceless
vandal.</p>

<p>In the two aisles on the opposite side of Henry VII.'s
Chapel lie the remains of these two rival queens, Elizabeth
and Mary, the one beheaded by the other,&mdash;a striking
instance of the equality of the grave, and reminding us
of Macaulay's description of the Abbey as "the great temple
of silence and reconciliation, where the enmities of
twenty generations lie buried."</p>

<p>I have only touched in the briefest manner a few of
the many interesting monuments which throng the royal
chapels. But there is one thing that I must write to you
about before leaving the subject of Westminster Abbey
finally, and that is the vacant space in the Central Eastern
Chapel, where the body of the greatest man that ever
ruled England once lay, and the story of why his body is
not there now.</p>

<p>We have seen that Lord Macaulay speaks of Westminster
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Abbey as "the great temple of silence and reconciliation,
where the enmities of twenty generations lie
buried." In the same strain, Sir Walter Scott writes:</p>

</div>

<p>These are fine sentiments, and certainly the policy of the
authorities of the Abbey has been broad enough in some
respects, far too broad indeed, as many think, in the matter
of admitting the bodies of men of skeptical views and
evil lives to lie here alongside of the great and good in
God's house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Monuments
Denied to
Notable
Persons.</div>

<p>But in some other respects the policy has
been a narrow one. The erection of a
monument here to Louis Napoleon, the late
Prince Imperial of France, who fell in Zululand
while fighting in the cause of England, was prevented
by what has been called "the illiberal clamor of an
ignorant faction." By the way, within the precincts of
the Roman Catholic Oratory of Brompton, in West London,
stands a statue of Cardinal Newman, the most distinguished
of modern apostates, who forsook the English
Church for the Romish; it was intended for Oxford, but
was refused by the University, and not allowed a place
in the streets of London. These two are not very good
examples of the kind of narrowness to which I refer,&mdash;one
can hardly blame the English churchmen for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
treatment accorded to Newman's statue,&mdash;they are simply
instances which naturally come to mind in connection
with the general subject. I will give an example presently
of the complete triumph of prejudice in the exclusion
from the Abbey of the greatest man of action that England
ever produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Objection
to Milton.</div>

<p>Meantime, as leading up to that, let us note
the remark of Dr. Gregory to Dr. Johnson
when, in 1737, the monument of Milton was placed in
the Abbey: "I have seen erected in the church a bust of
that man whose name I once knew considered a pollution
of its walls." He was referring to the action of Dean
Sprat in cutting away a part of the fulsome epitaph on
the tomb of John Philips which compared him to Milton,
of whom he was a feeble imitator. "The line, '<i>Uni Miltono
secundus, primoque paene par</i>,' was effaced under
Dean Sprat, not because of its almost profane arrogance,
but because the royalist dean would not allow even the
name of the regicide Milton to appear within the Abbey&mdash;it
was 'too detestable to be read on the wall of a building
dedicated to devotion.' The line was restored under Dean
Atterbury," and, as already noted, a bust of the great
Puritan genius was installed in the Abbey a few decades
later, so that the triumph of prejudice in this case was
short-lived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Meigs and
President Davis.</div>

<p>The story reminds one of the action of
General Meigs in removing the name of
President Davis from the record-stone of
the Cabin John Bridge near Washington.
This magnificent aqueduct bridge, one of the largest and
most beautiful single stone arches in the world, was
erected by Jefferson Davis while Secretary of War for
the United States, and of course his name, with those of
the then President and other high officials of the government,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
was placed on the completed structure. When the
Civil War came on, and Mr. Davis was elected President
of the Confederate States, General Meigs had the misfortune
to lose a son in battle in Virginia. One can feel profound
sympathy with him in such a bereavement, but does
it not seem a small and childish thing that he should
then have had Mr. Davis' name chiselled off the bridge
in revenge? And has not his action, like Dean Sprat's,
defeated itself? The blank made in the inscription excited
curiosity and gave rise to questions, which brought
out the whole story, and thus reminded many people who
might otherwise have forgotten it, what eminent services
Jefferson Davis had rendered to the united country before
the unhappy division which made him the President of
that portion of it with which his greater fame is now
associated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Vindication
of Cromwell.</div>

<p>To but few men in her long history is England
so deeply indebted as to Oliver Cromwell.
Clarendon's <i>History of the Rebellion</i>, written by a
bitterly hostile and prejudiced contemporary, effectually
blackened Cromwell's character for some two hundred
years, the misrepresentation being continued by other
royalist writers, such as Sir Walter Scott in <i>Woodstock</i>.
Carlyle's publication of Cromwell's own letters proved
that he had been grossly slandered, and put it beyond
question that the Protector was a sincere and godly man
and a true patriot, as well as the greatest man of action
that had ever lived in England. This is the view taken
of Cromwell by the more recent biographies of him,
which have been coming from the press in significantly
rapid succession, such as Hood's, Gardiner's, John Morley's
and President Roosevelt's. So that in several senses
Cromwell is coming to his own again, though his work
seemed at one time to have failed utterly, and to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
been swept clean away by the restoration of Charles II.
to the throne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Treatment of
his Dead Body.</div>

<p>It is of the indignities visited upon Cromwell's
remains at the time of this Restoration
that I wish to tell you. The great men of the Commonwealth
and several members of Cromwell's family
were buried in the extreme eastern end of the Abbey.
After the Restoration they were disinterred from this honorable
place of sepulture, and the only member of the
Protector's family who was allowed to remain in the
Abbey was his second daughter, Elizabeth Claypole, "as
being both a royalist and a member of the Church of
England."</p>

<p>The bodies of Cromwell, his son-in-law, General Ireton,
and Bradshaw, the judge who had condemned
Charles I., were dragged through London on sledges and
hanged at Tyburn, and their heads were set up on the
high roof-gable of Westminster Hall, the very building
in which Cromwell had been made Lord Protector of the
Commonwealth. It is safer to kick a dead lion than a
living one. Fancy these valiant royalists treating Cromwell
that way in his lifetime!</p>

<div class="sidenote">History of
Cromwell's
Head.</div>

<p>Cromwell's head having been embalmed before
his burial, "remained exposed to the
atmosphere for twenty-five years, and then
one stormy night it was blown down, and picked up by
the sentry, who, hiding it under his cloak, took it home
and secreted it in the chimney corner; and, as inquiries
were constantly being made about it by the government,
it was only on his death-bed that he revealed where he
had hidden it. His family sold the head to one of the
Cambridgeshire Russells, and in the same box in which
it still is, it descended to a certain Samuel Russell," who,
being in need, sold it to James Cox, the keeper of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
famous museum. Cox in turn sold it, about the time of
the French Revolution, for $1,150, to three men, who
made a business of exhibiting it at half a crown per head
in Bond Street, London. At the death of the last of these
three men, it came into the possession of his three nieces.
These young ladies, being nervous at keeping it in the
house, asked Mr. Horace Wilkinson, their physician, to
take charge of it for them, and finally sold it to him; and
in his house at Sevenoaks, Kent, the head of Oliver Cromwell
remains to this day.</p>

<p>It is a ghastly story, though I have been careful to
leave out the most gruesome details.</p>

<p>To-day, immediately in front of Westminster Hall,
where his head was first exposed in dishonor, stands a
bronze statue of the Great Protector, with a Bible in
one hand and a sword in the other,&mdash;erected within the
last five years,&mdash;and doubtless the day will come when a
monument of "the greatest prince that ever ruled England"
will be given its rightful place in Westminster
Abbey.</p>

<span class="smcap">London</span>, <i>October 2, 1902</i>.
</p>

<div class="sidenote">Original Significance
of the
Cathedrals.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Before</span> saying what I had in mind when I remarked,
in a former letter, that in some respects the English
cathedrals had proved to be hindrances to vital religion,
I wish to cite what Goldwin Smith says of the significance
and beauty of these glorious monuments of
mediæval piety: "Nothing so wonderful or
beautiful has ever been built by man as
these fanes of mediæval religion which still, surviving the
faith and the civilization which reared them, rise above
the din and smoke of modern life into purity and stillness.
In religious impressiveness they far excel all the works
of heathen art, and all the classical temples of the Renaissance.
Even in point of architectural skill they stand
unrivalled, though they are the creations of an age before
mechanical science. Their groined roofs appear still to
baffle imitation. But we do not fully comprehend the
marvel, unless we imagine the cathedrals rising, as they
did, out of towns which were then little better than collections
of hovels, with but small accumulation of wealth,
and without what we now deem the appliances of civilized
life. Never did man's spiritual aspirations soar so high
above the realities of his worldly lot as when he built
the cathedrals." The last proposition is not true. What
Professor Smith wished to say was that never did an
outward, material expression of man's religion so far surpass
all his other outward conditions. But even when
thus stated, it must be remembered that these great structures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
were not erected by those who inhabited the "hovels"
referred to, but by kings, or nobles, or prelates who lived
in palaces and rolled in wealth. Still, the cathedrals were
built as an expression of religion. Religion in the Middle
Ages expressed itself chiefly in the erection of these costly
and splendid buildings, as it now expresses itself chiefly
in missionary activity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Æsthetic
Influence.</div>

<p>Passing by, for the present, Westminster
Abbey, Canterbury and Winchester, which
excel all others in historical interest, and St. Paul's, which,
though the largest of all, is modern, we may agree fully
with Smith's estimate of the relative merits of the different
cathedrals and the effect produced by them: that "Salisbury
is the most perfect monument of mediæval Christianity
in England"; that in height and grandeur the
palm is borne off by York; in beauty and poetry, by
Lincoln; that Norman Durham, "half church of God,
half castle 'gainst the Scot," is profoundly imposing from
its massiveness, which seems enduring as the foundations
of the earth, as well as from its commanding situation;
that Ely also is a glorious pile, on its unique mound
among the fens; and that Wells and Salisbury are "the
two best specimens of the cathedral close, that haven of
religious calm amidst this bustling world, in which a man
tired of business and contentious life might delight, especially
if he has a taste for books, to find tranquillity, with
quiet companionship, in his old age. Take your stand on
the close of Salisbury or Wells on a summer afternoon
when the congregation is filing leisurely out from the
service and the sounds are still heard from the cathedral,
and you will experience a sensation not to be experienced
in the New World."</p>

<p>Having shown by these citations that Goldwin Smith
is not indifferent to the æsthetic influence of the cathedrals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
I wish now to quote from him a final paragraph
which states very well the practical point to which I referred
in the outset:</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Romanizing
Tendency.</div>

<p>"The cathedral and the parish church belong
to the present as well as to the past.
Indeed, they have been recently exerting a peculiar influence
over the present, for there can be no doubt that the
spell of their beauty and their adaptation, as places of
[Roman] Catholic devotion, to the Ritualistic rather than
to the Protestant form of worship have had a great effect
in producing the Neo-Catholic reaction of the last half
century. Creations of the religious genius of the Middle
Ages, they have been potent missionaries of the mediæval
faith."</p>

<p>I wish to call special attention to this ominous feature
of the influence of English cathedrals upon the forms,
and thus eventually upon the spirit, of Christian worship.
I am not unsusceptible, I think, to the glorious beauty
of these stately buildings, or the spell of their exquisite
music, or the fascination of their spectacular forms of
worship. I shall never forget the solemn impression
made upon my mind the first time I ever entered a great
cathedral, when, at Chester, I stepped from the broad
glare of outer sunshine into the cool, dim light of the
minster, and heard the choir of white-robed, sweet-voiced
boys responding with a prolonged, musical "A-men,"
accompanied by the great organ, as the priest intoned the
English service. But I am clear, nevertheless, that Goldwin
Smith is right in saying that by their adaptation to
the ritualistic rather than the Protestant form of worship
the cathedrals have been potent missionaries of the mediæval
faith.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic ideal of Christian worship is
very different from that of Protestants. Its functionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
is a priest, who offers sacrifice, and performs the ceremonies
of an elaborate ritual. Its appeal is chiefly to
the senses and the æsthetic sensibilities. Protestants, on
the other hand, hold that the minister is not a priest, but
a teacher; his function is not the performance of ceremonies,
but the inculcation of truth. The truly Protestant
churches appeal chiefly to the mind rather than
to the senses, they rely upon ideas rather than ceremonies,
because they know that only by the intelligent apprehension
of truth can the spiritual life be really nourished
and developed. In a Romish church the central thing is
the altar. In a Protestant church the central thing is the
pulpit. In short, Romish churches are built for ceremonies,
and Protestant churches for preaching. The cathedrals
were erected as Romish churches. There was little
or no thought of their being used for preaching. They
were erected as expressions in stone of religious aspiration;
they are "frozen music"; they are places for processions,
and incense, and altars, and pictures, and vestments,
and chants, but they are not adapted to preaching.
They are too large, for one thing. No man could make
himself heard throughout some of them. Nor was it
intended that he should.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Their Charm for
the Greatest of
the Puritans.</div>

<p>It is an extraordinary paradox that the
finest expression in any language of the idea
which lay in the minds of those who built
the cathedrals was given by a Puritan writer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"But let my due feet never fail</div>
    <div class="verse">To walk the studious cloisters pale;</div>
    <div class="verse">And love the high embowe'd roof</div>
    <div class="verse">With antique pillars massy proof:</div>
    <div class="verse">And storied windows, richly dight,</div>
    <div class="verse">Casting a dim, religious light.</div>
    <div class="verse">There let the pealing organ blow</div>
    <div class="verse">To the full-voic'd choir below,</div>
    <div class="verse">In service high and anthems clear,
	  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></div>
    <div class="verse">As may, with sweetness through mine ear,</div>
    <div class="verse">Dissolve me into ecstasies,</div>
    <div class="verse">And bring all heaven before mine eyes."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thus Milton in <i>Il Penseroso</i>, the interpretation of which
I must leave to the students of that exquisite poem. Only
let it not be forgotten that in his <i>Eikonoclastes</i>, Milton
ridicules the organs and the singing men in the King's
chapel, as well as the "English mass-book" of the "old
Ephesian goddess called the Church of England." I am
sorry to say, Milton is at times vituperative in his prose
writings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Half-reformed
Church.</div>

<p>Let us be more respectful in our references
to the Church of England. It contains
many good people and has done much good work. Still,
it is an indisputable fact that it never has been a thoroughly
reformed church. Its origin as a separate church
was different from that of the Reformed churches. Not
through the protracted struggles of people and ministers
did it win out clear from Romanism, with generally diffused
and clear convictions of truth, as was the case with
the really Reformed churches, but by the act of Henry
VIII. detaching a certain portion of the Catholic Church
from the papacy, for interesting domestic reasons, and
making himself the head of the church. That was the
origin of the Church of England as entirely distinct from
the Church of Rome. Henry did not wish to become a
Protestant at all, nor did he wish the people to change
their religion, and, as a matter of fact, he had people
burned alive for being Protestants. Of course, Protestantism
did make progress afterwards under Edward VI.
and Elizabeth, but there never was a sufficiently decisive
break with Romish doctrine and Romish forms of worship.
And, the architecture of the cathedrals and parish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
churches being what it is, there has been a constant tendency
to relapse to the Romish model outright.</p>

<p>If we seem to attribute too much influence to mere
architecture, let it be remembered that the structure and
arrangements of the college buildings at Oxford, which
did not admit of family life, but were designed for the
mediæval clerical students who were celibates, have had
a tendency to revive the monk, and that, as a matter of
fact, these Oxford colleges produced Newman and the
other leaders of the Anglo-Catholic reaction in our day,
to say nothing of Laud and his reaction two centuries ago.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relics of
Romanism.</div>

<p>How easily the cathedrals may aid Roman
Catholicism, and how strong is the lingering
influence of what Macaulay calls "that august and
fascinating superstition," may be seen not only in the
general character of the services, but also in certain details.
Each cathedral has what is still called a Lady
Chapel, that is, a chapel dedicated to Our Lady, the Virgin
Mary. In the Lady Chapel of Winchester Cathedral is
a series of highly prized wall paintings, of whose edifying
character the reader may judge when he learns that
one of them represents "the Virgin commanding the burial
of a clerk of <i>irreligious life</i> in consecrated ground, because
he had been her votary"; while another depicts a
miracle by an <i>image</i> of the Virgin, which is bending its
finger, so as to prevent a young man from taking off a
ring, given him by his lady love, which he had placed on
the image that it might not be lost or injured while he
played at ball. "By this the young man was won to
monastic life." Does this mean that he jilted the girl,
or that she discarded him for losing her ring?</p>

<p>Again, the inscription on the tomb of the builder of
that cathedral, William of Wykeham, the same who built
the round tower at Windsor Castle, records his work as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
bishop, politician, and founder of colleges, and concludes
with this injunction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"You who behold this tomb cease not to pray</div>
    <div class="verse">That, for such great merits, he may enjoy everlasting life."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Finally, the most striking effigy on any tomb in Winchester
Cathedral is that of a great dignitary of the
Romish Church, Cardinal Beaufort, represented here by
a very fine recumbent figure in scarlet cloak and hat. He
was enormously wealthy, was four times Lord Chancellor
of England, was present at the burning of Joan of Arc
at Rouen, and is said to have burst into tears and to have
left the horrible scene; but he persecuted the Lollards
and gave a half million pounds to put down the Hussites
in Bohemia, in which crusade he was general and legate.
Yet here he lies, one of the most honored figures, in what
is generally regarded as a Protestant church.</p>

<p>These points are sufficient to indicate what I mean
by saying that the cathedrals have in some respects had
an unfavorable influence upon the doctrine and worship
of the Church of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presbyterians
also have Felt
the Effect
of them.</div>

<p>If at the Reformation every cathedral in
Great Britain had been pounded to pieces
by the iconoclasts, it would have been an
immeasurable calamity to art, but it might
have been a real gain for religion. At any rate, it is
ritualism rather than religion that is now promoted by
the cathedrals. Nor is the English Church the only one
that has inherited these splendid but baleful monuments
of mediæval Romanism. The Presbyterian Church has
come into the possession of a few. The people of Scotland
at the time of the Reformation, remembering their
oppression and impoverishment by the great church establishments,
and disregarding the more moderate counsels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of their leaders, smashed most of these buildings which
fell to them, witness Melrose Abbey and many others&mdash;John
Knox speaks of "the rascal multitude" that destroyed
the buildings at Perth&mdash;but one or two they
spared, for example, the Cathedral at Glasgow. It is
maintained by some that the same tendency to ritualism
manifests itself in these Presbyterian cathedrals as in
others, though, of course, not to the same extent. Certainly
our simple and scriptural forms of worship, with
the prominence which they give to the preaching of the
Word, suit a warm, home-like church, where everything
can be heard, much better than they do a cold and vast
cathedral of stone which is too large for any congregation
that ever assembles in it, and where the voice of the
preacher is lost among the lofty arches.</p>

<p>While the Presbyterians have in some cases not freed
themselves completely from the Romish associations, and
in the great buildings which were erected for Romish
worship show something of the same tendency to undue
ritualism, still I think it will be generally conceded that
they severed the connection with Rome more effectually,
on the whole, than any other church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Protestant
Simplicity
more
Impressive.</div>

<p>Nor did their worship lose in real religious
impressiveness. Even Sir Walter Scott
(who, though a Presbyterian elder, had a
strong leaning to the ritualistic churches),
in the twentieth chapter of <i>Rob Roy</i>, puts into the mouth
of his hero this description of the Presbyterian service in
the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral:</p>

<p>"I had heard the service of high mass in France, celebrated
with all the <i>éclat</i> which the choicest music, the
richest dresses, the most imposing ceremonies, could confer
on it; yet it fell short in effect of the simplicity of
the Presbyterian worship. The devotion, in which every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
one took a share, seemed so superior to that which was
recited by musicians as a lesson which they had learned
by rote, that it gave the Scottish worship all the advantage
of reality over acting."</p>

<p>The more I see of the high church "service" the more
incomprehensible it seems to me that any thoughtful man
can take any other view than the one thus expressed by
Scott. The service he describes was indeed conducted in
a cathedral, but it was in the crypt, the part best adapted
to intelligent Protestant worship, on account of its smaller
dimensions and better acoustics.</p>

</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> does not follow, from what I said in my former letter
about the different forms of service in use among
Episcopalians and Presbyterians, respectively, that the
latter necessarily disapprove of the use of written prayers.
So far is this from being the case that Calvin and Knox
themselves wrote liturgies, though neither they nor their
successors believed in the rigid prescription of fixed forms,
but insisted upon ample freedom for the use of such
original prayers as occasion demanded. The Book of
Common Prayer itself, which is the product of every
Christian age and Christian people, including Reformers,
Presbyterians, Puritans and Lutherans, as well as Romanists
and Anglicans, and which is used constantly by the
Episcopal churches throughout the English-speaking
world, owes no little to the influence of men of our faith
and polity, and especially to that of the illustrious Genevan
reformer, John Calvin. The General Thanksgiving, called
"the chiefest treasure of the Prayer-Book," is said to
have been composed by the Rev. Dr. Edward Reynolds,
a distinguished Presbyterian member of the Westminster
Assembly of Divines, and afterwards Bishop of Norwich.
These prayers, as well as other parts of the Book of Common
Prayer, are constantly used, in whole or in part, by
many Presbyterian ministers when leading the public
devotions of their people, and the more such models of
prayer are studied by Presbyterian ministers in general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the sooner will they cease to deserve the reproach that
their manner of conducting this important part of public
worship is sometimes rambling, slovenly and unedifying.
No minister of our time of any denomination was more
acceptable and helpful in the conduct of this part of the
service than the late Rev. Dr. Moses D. Hoge, of Richmond.
His prayers were characterized in a preëminent
degree by good taste and propriety of expression, as well
as by unction. He was a diligent student of the best liturgies,
such as those of Calvin, Knox and Cranmer. His
biographer, speaking of "the elaborate and laborious
preparation that he made for this service, as evinced by
his papers," says: "Dr. Hoge's peculiar power in prayer
was not merely the result of what is called the 'gift of
prayer.' Not only his celebrated prayers on great public
occasions were carefully written out, but from his early
ministry he wrote prayers for every variety of occasion
and service, and formulated petitions on every variety of
topic."</p>

<p>When we visited Canterbury Cathedral, the

striking proof of the liberty of Presbyterian
usage in this matter. The place is, of course,
one that brings to mind innumerable events of interest,
ranging all the way from the tragedy of Thomas a
Becket's death to the comedy of the struggle that took
place in St. Catherine's Chapel, Westminster, in 1176,
between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, a
scuffle which led to the question of their precedence being
decided by a papal edict, giving to one the title of Primate
of all England, to the other that of Primate of England.
One cannot help thinking, in connection with it, of the
official titles of the two great Presbyterian bodies in our
country, the technical title of the Northern Church being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America,
and the technical title of the Southern Church being the
Presbyterian Church in the United States. Fuller's
<i>Church History</i> gives a racy account of the scene referred
to: "A synod was called at Westminster, the Pope's legate
being present thereat; on whose right hand sat Richard,
Archbishop of Canterbury, as in his proper place. When
in springs Roger of York, and finding Canterbury so
seated, fairly sits him down on Canterbury's lap (a baby
too big to be danced thereon); yea, Canterbury's servants
dandled this lap-child with a witness, who plucked him
thence, and buffeted him to purpose." But far more interesting
to us than the story of this undignified behavior
on the part of these two dignitaries, and even more interesting
than the thrilling story of Becket's murder, was
the chapel in the crypt, where for three hundred and fifty
years the Huguenots, who were welcomed by Queen
Elizabeth and given the use of this part of the cathedral,
have continued to use the ancient Presbyterian forms of
worship which they brought with them when driven from
France by Roman Catholic persecution. And it is a very
interesting fact that the liturgy (in French) which they
use is almost the same as the Book of Common Prayer,
but immensely significant that the congregation continues
to observe the Lord's Supper seated, after the Presbyterian
form. The communion plates and cups, which we
had the pleasure of taking up in our hands, were brought
by the refugees to England three hundred and fifty years
ago, but are still in use.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Concomitants
and the
Intoning.</div>

<p>From what has now been said, it is clear that
it is not altogether the use of the Prayer-Book
which gives to the American Protestant
worshipping in an Anglican church that curious
feeling of strangeness and formalism. It is rather the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
Romish-looking arrangements about the "altar," the
crosses and candles and cloths, the vestments and processions,
the turning of the people towards the east when
they pray, the "vain repetitions" of certain parts of the
liturgy, such as the Lord's Prayer, which sometimes occurs
four or five times in one service, and the "intoning" of the
service, that is, the literally monotonous recitation of the
prayers, without any rising or falling inflection, every
word being uttered in precisely the same tone, without the
slightest variation. I do not mean that all these features
always occur in every service. Sometimes one or more of
them will be omitted, such as turning to the east in prayer,
or intoning. For instance, Canon Hensley Henson, whom
we heard a short time ago at St. Margaret's, Westminster,
where the late Canon Farrar preached so long and so brilliantly,
and who, though quite radical in some of his views,
is the most thoughtful preacher among the ministers of the
Anglican Church in London at the present time, did not
intone the prayers which he offered, though his assistant
did. I do not know whether Canon Henson's usage is
from necessity or choice&mdash;whether it is because he cannot
intone or because he does not care to do so, preferring to
address the Almighty in the same natural and expressive
tones which he uses in communications with his fellow-men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canon Hensley
Henson at
St. Margaret's.</div>

<p>Canon Henson does not look the least like
the typical Englishman. His appearance is
antipodal to that of the beefy, bluff, full-blooded
John Bull. He is slender, clean-shaven, boyish,
white, his face "sicklied o'er with the pale cast of
thought." His body may be delicate, but there is no lack
of vigor about his mind. The strength and charm of his
preaching, due chiefly to the freshness of the thought
and the purity and clearness of the language&mdash;for he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
no marked advantages of presence or voice or manner&mdash;draw
great crowds to St. Margaret's. We had to wait
at the door for some time to let the pewholders have a
chance, but when the word was given the crowd at the
door poured in and quickly overflowed all the vacant
seating space. Shortly after he began his sermon, which
was read throughout, three ladies rose to leave the church,
and I was not a little astonished to hear him stop and
say, with what I thought was a touch of irritation, "I
will wait till those ladies get out." No doubt it is vexatious
to have people leave the church during the sermon,
but no minister has a right to pillory anybody in that
fashion, unless it is somebody who is known to be in the
habit of interrupting the service in that way. The minister
has no right to assume that people are doing a deliberately
discourteous or culpably thoughtless thing. The
probability is that one of the ladies in the group referred
to was sick or faint and had to withdraw. This kind of
rudeness may be naturally expected from some of the men
who in our country have done so much to degrade the
fine name of "Evangelist," but surely one does not expect
it from a gentleman like Canon Henson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canon Henson
on Anglican
Narrowness.</div>

<p>While bound to criticise Canon Henson for
this breach of good manners, I hasten to
express my cordial admiration of his courtesy,
courage, and Christliness in general, and especially
of the power of his statement of the claims of Christian
love against the Anglican custom of refusing to commune
with Nonconformists. The most remarkable sermon
preached by any clergyman of the Established Church
during our sojourn in England was a sermon preached
by him before the University of Cambridge on the text,
"There shall be one fold and one Shepherd," in which
he advocated the admission of Nonconformists to the
sacrament. Hear him:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"The primary need of the hour is more religious honesty.
In the classic phrase of Dr. Johnson, Churchmen
beyond all others need 'to clear their minds of cant.' '<i>Let
love be without hypocrisy</i>' is the kindred protest of St.
Paul. Bear with me while I bring these considerations
to a very simple, indeed an obvious application. On all
hands there is talk of Christian unity. Not a Conference
or a Congress of Churchmen meets without effusive welcome
from Nonconformists. A few weeks ago I sat in
the Congress Hall at Brighton and listened to a series
of speeches by prominent Nonconformists, all expressing
the warmest sentiments of Christian fraternity. I reflected
that by the existing law and current practice of
our church all those excellent orators and their fellow-believers
were spiritual outcasts; that, if they presented
themselves for the Sacrament of Unity, they would be
decisively rejected; that, in no consecrated building,
might their voices be heard from the pulpit, though all
men&mdash;as in the case of Dr. Dale, of Birmingham&mdash;owned
their conspicuous power and goodness. The contradiction
came home to my conscience as an intolerable
outrage, and I determined to say here to-day in this
famous pulpit, to which your kindness has bidden me,
what I had long been thinking, that the time has come
for Churchmen to remove barriers for which they can no
longer plead political utility, and which have behind them
no sanctions in the best conscience and worthiest reason
of our time. I remembered that in my study, at work
in preparation of the sermons which expressed my obligation
as a Christian teacher, I drew no invidious distinctions.
Baxter and Jeremy Taylor, Dale and Gore,
Ramsay and Lightfoot, Döllinger and Hort, George Adam
Smith and Driver, Ritschl and Moberley, Fairbairn and
Westcott, Bruce and Sanday, Liddon and Lacordaire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
these and many others of all Christian churches united
without difficulty in the fellowship of sacred science; it
was not otherwise in my devotions. Roman Catholic,
Lutheran, Anglican, Nonconformist were reconciled
easily enough in the privacy of prayer and meditation.
The two persons whom I venerated as the best Christians
I knew, and to whom spiritually I owed most, were not
Anglicans. Only in the sanctuary itself was the hideous
discovery vouchsafed that they were outcasts from my
fellowship. I might feed my mind with their wisdom, and
kindle my devotion with their piety, and stir my conscience
with their example, but I might not break bread
with them at the table of our common Lord, nor bear
their presence as teachers in the churches dedicated to
his worship. It seemed to me that the love so lavishly
expressed in that Congress Hall must, at least on our
side, be a strangely hollow thing. It is true that the
presiding bishop reminded the Nonconformists that there
were doctrinal differences which could not be forgotten
or minimized, but this obstacle was effectively demolished
by the debates of the Congress&mdash;debates which revealed
the widest possible doctrinal divergence between men
who, none the less, communicated at the same altars and
owned allegiance to the same church."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What Canon
Henson could
see in Virginia.</div>

<p>Such a discourse from such a man in such
a place naturally created a sensation in
England. It would not have done so, as to
its main point, in Virginia. Why? Well, the fundamental
reason is that the average Virginia Episcopalian represents
a much higher type of Christianity than the average
English churchman, broader, sweeter, truer. Indeed, if
there are in any church anywhere people of lovelier character,
truer charity, and more genuine devotion to our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Lord than the evangelical Episcopalians of Virginia, many
of whom it has been my good fortune to know long and
intimately, I have never heard of them. I only wish the
type was more common in some other parts of the country.
Now, the things so trenchantly stated by Canon
Henson in the foregoing excerpt are mere matters of
course to the mind of your evangelical Low Churchman
in Virginia. To him it is no uncommon thing to break
bread with Christians of other denominations at the table
of our common Lord or to hear the gospel preached by
ministers of other churches from the pulpits of his own.
I have heard it said that this fraternal attitude is deprecated
by some of the younger clergy in Virginia of late,
and that through their opposition this open recognition
of other Christian people and their ministers is less common
than it used to be. I should be sorry to believe it,
and I know some facts which seem to disprove it. Four
or five years ago I myself was invited to deliver the
Reinicke Lecture to the students of the Episcopal Seminary
at Alexandria, Va., and did so with a feeling of as
cordial welcome as I had ever received anywhere in my
whole life. I have been repeatedly invited to preach in
Episcopal pulpits. When the General Assembly of our
church meets in Lexington, Va., next May, you may rely
upon it Presbyterian ministers will be invited by the rector
of the Episcopal church there to supply his pulpit on
Sunday, just as they are by the pastors of the other
churches. More than that, I have a friend in the Presbyterian
ministry, now a pastor in Baltimore, who not
long ago, by invitation of the vestry of an Episcopal
church in a Virginia town, not only occupied the pulpit
and preached, but also wore the surplice and administered
the sacrament of the Lord's Supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Are Virginia
Episcopalians
Becoming
Less Liberal?</div>

<p>It may be true that there is a reaction going
on even in Virginia against this spirit of
Christian fellowship, and that things of this
kind are less frequent than formerly; but,
if so, I am satisfied that it is a reaction with which the
Virginia laymen have nothing to do, and which they will
oppose as soon as they become aware of it,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and I am
sure, too, that clergymen will not be lacking who will
make a strong stand against it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decreasing
Attendance
in the Anglican
Churches in
London.</div>

<p>One or two other facts which may well be
pondered by High Churchmen have been
brought to light by the census of church
attendance in London, recently taken by the
<i>Daily News</i> of that city. The census shows
that, while more than one-half of the five millions of
people in London are Christian worshippers, there has
been a decrease in church attendance of over one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
thousand since 1886, that this decrease has been
almost entirely in the congregations of the Church of
England, and that the attendance in the Established and
Nonconformist churches is now about equal.</p>

<p>The census shows further that in wealthy districts
the Established Church, as we might expect, has the majority.
As was also expected, Nonconformists have a
majority in middle-class districts. But, contrary to all
expectations, Nonconformists are a majority in the working-class
districts and among the very poor. It was often
said that only the ritualists were getting hold of the poor,
and many supposed the Salvation Army was doing great
things amongst the lowest people. It is one of the surprises
of the census that ritualism fails to attract the non-churchgoing
classes.</p>

<p>In the proportion of the sexes present, in almost all
cases the Episcopal churches showed two women to one
man; in nonconformist churches the proportion of men
was greater, being two men to three women. Does not
this preponderance of men in the nonconformist congregations
indicate clearly that if the Church of England
is to retain her hold upon men she must lay less stress
upon the appeal to the æsthetic sensibilities and more
upon the appeal to the mind; that she must make less
of the ornamental features of public worship and more
of the didactic; less of millinery, music and marching,
and more of the preaching of the gospel? As the <i>British
Weekly</i> puts it:</p>

<p>"The great means of attracting the people is Christian
preaching. Whenever a preacher appears, no matter what
his denomination is, he has a great audience. Nothing
makes up for a failure in preaching. The churches of all
denominations, if they are wise, will give themselves with
increased zeal and devotion to the training of the Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
ministry. I have no doubt that it is for lack of a trained
order of preachers that the Salvation Army has failed
in London. Nor will any magnificence of ritual or any
musical attractions, or any lectures on secular subjects,
permanently attract worshippers. It can be done only by
Christian preaching."</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Episcopalian
Estimate of
Presbyterian
Preaching.</div>

<p>In this connection the following clipping
from <i>The Evangelist</i> is not without interest,
as showing that both the disease and the
remedy are at least partially recognized by
some observers within the English Church:</p>

<p>"A recent writer in <i>The Guardian</i>, one of the leading
Church of England papers, laments the decay of preaching
within his own communion, and is forced to contrast
the conditions obtaining in Presbyterian churches with
those which prevail in Episcopalian ones, to the obvious
disadvantage of the latter. While it is true that the
Church of England has some great preachers, as it always
has had, the ordinary village vicar is scarcely mediocre.
Such is not the case among the Presbyterians&mdash;in Scotland,
with which the writer is familiar&mdash;or in America,
Canada, Australia, or in missionary lands, where the same
standards and ideals are in effect. Here are the characteristics
of Presbyterian preaching as described by a
Church of England critic:</p>

<p>"'Their ministry lays itself out for the cultivation of
prophetical power, and not without success. In general,
they are students of Hebrew, which the English clergy
are not. The consequence is that for a good Old Testament
sermon you must go north of the Tweed. In England
we confine ourselves almost exclusively to the New
Testament, not merely because of its transcendent importance,
but because it is ground with which we are more
familiar. But the loss to our people is great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Then, again, the Scottish ministers are students of
German theology. More or less they are at home in the
writings of the great German thinkers, both orthodox and
liberal. We, as a rule, are not....</p>

<p>"'One more point. In travelling through Palestine
some years ago, with a view to the study of biblical
geography, I was greatly struck with the preponderance
of Scottish ministers who were there on the same purpose
intent. I think it no exaggeration to say that they were
in numbers to the English clergy as five to one. Evidently
they regard it as a necessary part of that same biblical
equipment they are so careful about, that they should with
their own eyes realize the scenes of the sacred narrative.
A pilgrimage to the Holy Land is now so easy, and is,
moreover, to any thoughtful Christian teacher so fruitful
in results, that it is a marvel it should not be made an
ordinary addition to a university or theological college
course. To any one who will go with a reverent mind
and open eyes, and with his Bible as his Baedeker, it is
an unparalleled experience for life. If it is objected to
on the score of expense, I ask, How do the Presbyterian
ministers, and a large proportion of Nonconformist ministers
also, manage to accomplish it?'"</p>

<p>The <i>Guardian</i> itself, in an editorial comment on the
decreasing attendance of men in the Anglican churches,
says frankly that a large number of men are "repelled
by the extremely low standard of preaching which prevails,
and the comparative success of Nonconformity may
be due in part to the attention which is devoted to the
preparation of the sermon." "Another source of offence
is the over-elaboration of musical services, and the practical
exclusion of the congregation from any real share
in prayer and praise. It is a fatal policy which drives
the devout but unmusical away from our churches to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
chapels in which they can find greater simplicity and
greater heartiness. One of the surprises of the census
has been that the Nonconformists have been found to be
strong not only in middle-class districts, but in the regions
where poverty abounds. The poor, we believe, are attracted
by greater simplicity, and it must be acknowledged
that the services of our Prayer-Book are difficult
for the uninstructed to follow and to appreciate. There
is a stage at which a greater elasticity of worship is
needed, and for this we make no adequate provision."</p>

<p>According to the latest statistics, the relative strength
of the Established Church and the free evangelical
churches is as follows:</p>

It was an immense satisfaction to me to
learn, on my return to America, that in the matter of the proposed
change in the name of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
the laity had saved the day and decisively defeated the clerical
delegates who represented the pro-Catholic sentiment, and wished
to call their denomination the American Catholic Church, and
thus make it appear that there was closer sympathy between
Episcopacy and Romanism than between Episcopacy and Protestantism.
In one diocese in particular, in which I have always
felt a peculiar interest, although the Bishop in his opening address
made a strong plea for the change, and although he carried the
clergy with him, he and they were overwhelmingly defeated by
the lay delegates. Would it not be a singular situation if the
clergy, the official leaders of the people in spiritual things, should
come to stand as a class for all that is reactionary or bigoted
or trivial, while the people themselves represented the real spirit
of Christ? There may be such a tendency on the part of the
clergy in other dioceses, but I can hardly believe that it is true
of those in Virginia.</p></div></div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> English Channel is one of the oldest ferries in
the world. For two thousand years and more, men
have been crossing it in all sorts of craft, but they have
never yet found a way to do it comfortably when the
water is rough, as it generally is. Our experience made
us doubt whether the modern steamers that ply between
New Haven and Dieppe are a whit more comfortable than
the galleys of Julius Cæsar. Our boat was mercilessly
buffeted by the winds. She rolled and plunged in every
direction. It seemed to us that her propeller was out of
the water half the time. If seasickness really is good
for people, this Channel should be called a health resort.
All the members of our party were violently sick except
myself. We felt sure we had discovered one of the
reasons why the shore to which we looked so wistfully
is called "the pleasant land of France." Any land would
seem pleasant after that dreadful Channel. At last we
reached it, pale and wretched. As we entered the mouth
of the river at Dieppe the huge crucifix overhanging the
harbor reminded us that we were now in a Roman Catholic
country. And a "pleasant land" it is in many respects.
Our railroad journey to Paris through the fair and fertile
Valley of the Seine made that quite evident.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The External
Beauty of
the French
Capital.</div>

<p>We secured quiet and comfortable quarters
close to the lovely Madeleine Church and
only two blocks from the Place de la Concorde,
the finest square in Europe, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Seine on one side, the Tuileries Gardens on another, the
Champs Élysées leading from it in one direction, and
the Rue de Rivoli in the other. London, as we have
seen, is a dingy congeries of dingy towns built mostly
of dingy bricks. Paris is sunny and bright, the streets
are wide and clean, and the houses are uniformly handsome,
being built of a light stone that gives the whole
city an air of elegance. No doubt it is the most beautiful
city in the world, it has a glitter and sparkle unmatched
elsewhere,&mdash;but, gay as it seems, it has more suicides
than any other city.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What we did
not like
about Paris.</div>

<p>We submitted to it, but could not enjoy
the French custom of taking our morning
rolls and coffee in bed. There are many
other French customs constantly in evidence in Paris,
but not to be described here, to which I trust our English
and American people will never become accustomed.
Modesty is not prominent among the virtues of the
French, though of course there must be many good people
among them. Vice flaunts itself more in Paris than in
any city I have ever seen. There is a certain brazen
shamelessness even in French art that one does not see
in New York or London. But the collection in the Louvre
is one of the richest aggregations of antiquarian and
artistic objects in the world, and surely no museum was
ever so splendidly housed. The Moabite Stone, the oldest
extant Hebrew inscription, was one of the things that we
made a point of seeing. As we passed to another part of
the great building, we had the pleasure of seeing the celebrated
DeWet and the other Boer generals who were
visiting Paris at that time.</p>

<p>In the rear of the Louvre stands the church of St.
Germain l'Auxerrois. It was from the bell-tower of this
church that the signal was given for the Massacre of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
St. Bartholomew. On the other side of the Rue de Rivoli,
and in plain view of this fateful tower, stands the pure
white marble statue of Admiral Coligni, the most illustrious
victim of that fearful massacre. What France
needs to-day is the influence of that Huguenot element
which she slaughtered and expelled at that time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenot
Name and the
Huguenot
Character.</div>

<p>Several names which are now among the
most illustrious in the history of the world
were originally used as terms of reproach.
When Abram left his home in
Chaldea and crossed the great boundary stream between
the East and the West and settled in Palestine, the Canaanites
dubbed him "the Hebrew," that is, the man who
crossed over the Euphrates&mdash;intruder, interloper. But
for ages "Hebrew" has been the honored designation of
one of the most gifted and enterprising of the races of
mankind. It is not unlikely that the name "Christian"
was first applied in a contemptuous sense to the disciples
of our Lord at Antioch. It is well known that the name
of "Methodist," which is now the honored designation
of a large, active and devoted body of the people of God,
was at first given to the followers of Wesley in a spirit
of ridicule and derision. In like manner, the name
"Huguenot," according to its most probable derivation
from a French word meaning a kind of hobgoblin of
darkness, a night-wanderer, was given to the Protestants
of that country, because there were times in their early
history when, for fear of persecution, they dared not meet
except under cover of darkness. But this term of reproach
has gathered about itself all the glory that belongs
to genius and skill in the useful arts, to industry, thrift
and purity in the home, to patriotic valor on the field
of battle, and to unpurchasable and unconquerable devotion
to principle, and is now a name that is venerated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
every clear-headed and sound-hearted and well-informed
and unprejudiced person in the world. It is a name which
will wear forever the red halo of martyrdom. By the
Massacre of St. Bartholomew alone thirty-five thousand
names were added to the church's crimson roll of martyrs,
with that of the great Admiral Coligni leading the list.
By the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and the refusal
of Louis XIV. to tolerate any exercise of the Protestant
religion in France, while at the same time punishing
inexorably all who attempted to escape from France,
nearly half a million Huguenots were driven into exile,
sacrificing their homes, their property and their country
rather than renounce their religion; and Sismondi estimates
that some four hundred thousand others perished
in prison, on the scaffold, at the galleys, and in their
attempts to escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Palissy, the
Potter.</div>

<p>On our visit to the celebrated Porcelain
Works at Sevres, a few miles below Paris
on the Seine, our interest centered less in any of the
works of art shown inside than in the fine bronze figure
in front of the building which represents Bernard Palissy,
natural philosopher, chemist, geologist, artist, political
economist, Christian hero and author, of whom Lamartine
himself said, "This potter was one of the greatest
writers of the French tongue. Montaigne does not excel
him in freedom, Rousseau in vigor, La Fontaine in grace,
Bossuet in lyric energy." He was the inventor of enamelled
pottery. For fifteen years he pursued his search
for the secret of his art, scorned as a visionary, suspected
of being a counterfeiter, reproached by his wife for the
scanty living he provided for his family, sitting by his
fire for six successive days and nights without changing
his clothes, and, in his last desperate experiment, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
fuel began to run short and still the enamel did not melt,
rushing into the house, breaking up his furniture and
hurling that into the furnace to keep up the heat&mdash;his
long and furious search being rewarded at last by the
appearance of the beautiful white glaze which has made
him famous. His transcendant merits as an artist were
then fully recognized, and the Duke of Montmorency and
Catherine de Medici became his patrons, the latter appointing
him to decorate the gardens of the palace of the
Tuileries. But in the meantime he had founded the Reformed
Church at Saintes, and had revolutionized the
morals of the community. He was seized, dragged from
his home, and hurried off by night to be punished as a
heretic. And the most brilliant genius of France would
certainly have been burnt, as hundreds of others were,
but for the accidental circumstance that the Duke of
Montmorency was in urgent need of enamelled tiles for
his castle floor, and Palissy was the only man in the
world capable of executing them.</p>

<p>Few scenes in history can match that in the Bastile
when this aged and gifted man lay chained to the floor,
and Henry III., standing over him, and referring to the
forty-five years of faithful and splendid service which
Palissy had rendered, said, "I am now compelled to leave
you to your enemies, and to-morrow you will be burnt
unless you become a Roman Catholic." Then the fearless
answer: "Sire, you have often said you pity me. I now
pity you. 'Compelled!' It is not spoken like a king.
These girls, my companions, and I, who have a portion
in the kingdom of heaven, will teach you royal language.
<i>I cannot be compelled to do wrong.</i> Neither you nor the
Guises will know how to compel a potter to bow the knee
to images."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Huguenot
Heroes and
Heroines.</div>

<p>French Protestantism is rich also in memories
of heroic women. There is the record,
for example, of Charlotte de Laval, sitting
by her husband, Admiral Coligni, on the balcony of their
castle, and asking, "Husband, why do you not openly
avow your faith, as your brother Andelot has done?"
"Sound your own soul," was his reply; "are you prepared
to be chased into exile with your children, and
to see your husband hunted to the death? I will give you
three weeks to consider, and then I will take your advice."
She looked at him a moment through her tears, and said,
"Husband, the three weeks are ended; do your duty,
and leave us to God." The world knows well the sequel.</p>

<p>Surely no right-minded person can refuse to honor
such sacrifices for principle, such loyalty to conscience,
such devotion to Christ. The Huguenots could have
remained peaceful and prosperous in their own country
had they but been willing to conform to the Romish
religion.</p>

<p>The views I am expressing are not determined merely
by my Protestant birth and training. In proof of this,
let me quote to you the words of the Duke of Saint Simon,
himself a Roman Catholic and a courtier of Louis XIV.:
"The Revocation of the Edict of Nantes ... as well
as the various proscriptions that followed, were the fruits
of that horrible conspiracy which depopulated a fourth
part of the kingdom, ruined its trade, weakened it
throughout, surrendered it for so long a time to open and
avowed pillage by the dragoons, and authorized the torments
and sufferings by means of which they procured
the death of so many persons of both sexes and by thousands
together.... A plot that caused our manufactures
to pass over into the hands of foreigners, made
their states to flourish and grow populous at the expense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of our own, and enabled them to build new cities. A plot
that presented to the nations the spectacle of so vast a
multitude of people, who had committed no crime, proscribed,
denuded, fleeing, wandering, seeking an asylum
afar from their country. A plot that consigned the noble,
the wealthy, the aged, those highly esteemed for their
piety, their learning, their virtue, those accustomed to a
life of ease, frail, delicate, to hard labor in the galleys,
under the driver's lash, and for no reason save that of
their religion."</p>

<p>Such are the blistering words of this eminent Roman
Catholic nobleman in regard to the policy of the church
of which he was a member. If a fair-minded member
of that communion can thus condemn these horrible
iniquities and thus extol the persecuted Huguenots as the
best people in France, surely no Protestant should ever
hesitate about recognizing clearly the world's debt to this
pure and heroic people. And no well-informed Protestant
ever does. The Rev. Dr. Croly, of the Church of England,
late rector of St. Stephens, in London, expresses
the opinion of all who know the facts when he says:
"The Protestant Church of France was for half a century
unquestionably one of the most illustrious churches
in Europe. It held the gospel in singular purity. Its
preachers were apostolic. Its people the purest, most
intellectual and most illustrious of France."</p>

<div class="sidenote">France's Loss
the World's
Gain.</div>

<p>Now that is the church which was all but
stamped out of existence by the fierce persecutions
of the papacy two hundred years
ago. And it is the remnant of that glorious church which
now calls on all Christians to help it to give once more
the pure gospel to priest-ridden, infidel France, and to
deliver the nation from that fearful succession of bloody
revolutions and Panama scandals and Dreyfus outrages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
and shameless immoralities which have so largely constituted
the history of that unhappy land since it butchered
and banished the only class of its people who would have
effectually kept its conscience true, its morality pure, and
its institutions stable and sound.</p>

<p>Do we owe the Huguenots anything? Yes, the whole
world is indebted to them. What France lost the other
nations gained. The emigration of the Huguenots gave
a death-blow to several great branches of French industry.
The population of Nantes was reduced from eighty thousand
to forty thousand, a blow to its prosperity from
which it has not recovered to this day. Of twelve thousand
artisans engaged in the manufacture of silk at Lyons,
nine thousand went to Switzerland. The most skilled
artisans, the wealthiest merchants, the bravest sailors and
soldiers, the most eminent scholars and scientists went by
thousands to Germany, Holland, England, enriching those
lands in money and morals beyond computation.</p>

<p>The cause of civil and religious liberty is deeply indebted
to the Huguenots. It was Oliver Cromwell, "the
greatest prince that ever ruled England," who raised
Britain to her present position of power and gave her the
dominion of the seas. But it was William of Orange
who completed Cromwell's work after the temporary
reaction in favor of Rome and the Stuarts. It was the
battle of the Boyne which finally decided that Great
Britain and America were to be Protestant countries and
not Romish. And do you know who it was that won the
day for William on the banks of the Boyne? It was the
three regiments of Huguenot infantry and the squadron
of Huguenot cavalry hurled upon the Papists at the
critical moment by the Huguenot, Marshal Schomberg.
That is a part of your debt to the Huguenots for the civil
and religious liberty which you enjoy to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>In the Franco-German War of 1870, many of the
officers of the victorious army of invasion were descendants
of the Huguenots whom Louis XIV. expatriated.</p>

<p>The King of England himself is of Huguenot blood,
George I. having married Dorothea, granddaughter of the
Marquis d'Olbreuse, who was one of the Huguenot refugees
to Brandenburg after the Revocation. Time would
fail me to tell of all the scholars, scientists and noblemen
of England who have sprung from the same great stock,
such as Grote, the historian of Greece, Sydney Smith,
the Martineaus, Garrick the actor, and a great number
of gifted clergymen of the Church of England.</p>

<p>Many of the French churches established in London
and other parts of England by the exiles have contributed
for centuries to the vigorous religious life of Britain.
For three hundred and fifty years the Presbyterian
Huguenots and the Episcopal Englishmen have worshipped
in different portions of Canterbury Cathedral,
and to this day the Huguenot Church at Canterbury continues
to conduct its worship in the cathedral in French,
singing the psalms to the old Huguenot tunes. But for
the most part, the exiles have become merged with the
English, and their names have been Anglicised. In every
way Britain has been enriched and blessed by the infusion
of Huguenot blood and genius.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Huguenot Strain
in America.</div>

<p>What America owes to Huguenot immigration
you know. Had the Huguenots given
us only Hugh Swinton Legare, John Jay, Francis Marion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and Commodore Maury, "the pathfinder of the seas," we
should have owed them an everlasting debt of gratitude.
But when we remember what they have been in Virginia
itself&mdash;the Maurys, Maryes, Michauxs, Flournoys,
Dupuys, Fontaines, Moncures, Fauntleroys, Latanes,
Mauzys, Lacys, Venables, Dabneys, and many others&mdash;we
cannot fail to see that we are under great and lasting
obligation to that heroic race, whose banishment, while
it resulted in the moral ruin of France, resulted in the
moral enrichment of America. And we should count it a
privilege to do what we can to retrieve the religious ruin
of misguided France by giving her once more the pure
Huguenot gospel. From a statement published by the
Rev. J. E. Knatz, B. D., Delegate of the Huguenot
Churches of France to America, I take the following
facts:</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Huguenot
Revival in
France.</div>

<p>The population of France is composed of
six hundred thousand Protestants and
nearly thirty-nine million Catholics. The
former are mostly descendants of the Huguenots. In
spite of centuries of persecution, which reduced them
to a mere handful, they have not only kept their ground,
but made important advance. They are the strongest
bulwark of republican institutions. In the Dreyfus trial,
they were foremost in forming a better public opinion,
fighting the hardest for the triumph of truth and justice.
Lately a Catholic paper had to admit, reluctantly, that
for the last twenty-five years the war waged against
intemperance, immorality and other social evils, had been
the work of the Protestants.</p>

<p>Outside of France the Huguenots carry on a great
missionary work in the French colonies, which are many
and extensive. The religious reorganization of Madagascar
alone cost them two hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>In France they have to care for the spiritual welfare
of an ever-increasing number of non-Protestant communities.
The movement toward Protestantism is making
great progress in the rural districts, the population of
which, all Catholics, had been hitherto indifferent or
bigoted. New Huguenot churches are springing up on
all sides, often in places where Protestant worship had
been abolished for over two hundred years.</p>

<p>The tears and blood our fathers shed, the torments
they suffered on scaffolds and stakes, are bringing forth
fruit after many years, and "the harvest is truly plenteous."
In two departments of Central France alone,
forty-five villages have, within a single year, besought
our societies for regular Protestant services. To this
church extension work alone the French Protestants contribute
one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars
annually.</p>

<p>Congregations of two hundred members (not one of
whom was brought up in the evangelical faith), Sunday-schools
of fifty children (none of whom a year before
had ever heard of the Bible), are common results of our
work.</p>

<p>Other missionary enterprises have to devise means of
attracting audiences. With us there is no such difficulty,
crowds gather wherever we are able to send ministers.</p>

<p>Where in the whole world could be found so promising
a mission field&mdash;one ready to yield such rich returns?
Where could be found people so eager to listen to the
preaching of the gospel, and to have their children taught
its lessons?</p>

<p>As well as a most promising, France is a most important
mission field. The conversion, within the next
few years, of some thousands of French people, would
be of incalculable value to the religious and moral welfare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
of the world, for France exerts a mighty influence
throughout the world. Moreover, the outlay would be
comparatively small.</p>

<p>There are men willing to bring the Bread of Life to
the hungering crowds for a mere pittance, prompted, not
by any worldly motive, but by the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>The salary of a minister is only four hundred dollars.
This amount will send one more to some of the many
localities from which urgent appeals have come; it will
open a new district to the permanent influence of the
gospel.</p>

<p>No movement of such size and promise has been witnessed
in France since the time of the Reformation. It
is the old light, the eternal light from above, dawning
again on France, illuminating the approach of a new century
and bringing hope for the future.</p>

<p>Let the Christians of America help the Huguenot
Church of France in this great work of hers.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>At the American Church in Paris, whose pastor, the
Rev. Dr. Thurber, showed us many courtesies, we had
the pleasure, a few days ago, of hearing a very striking
address by the Rev. Merle D'Aubigné, son of the well-known
historian of the Reformation, which abounded
with equally awakening facts as to the present religious
condition of France.</p>

<p>Paris is not only one of the most brilliant, but one
of the most interesting cities in the world, from almost
every point of view, and we revelled in its museums and
monuments; but its memories of the Huguenots had more
interest for us than anything else, and we have thought
it best to devote our space to that subject rather than to
the Louvre, the tomb of Napoleon, Notre Dame, Versailles,
Fontainebleau, and the scores of other fascinating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
places and subjects that appeal to one's interest in this
ancient, gay, and terrible city.</p>

<p>We had a rainy day at Brussels and a cold one on the
battlefield of Waterloo, but were not deterred from seeing
them by these conditions of the weather. Then, with
a comfortable feeling, almost like the feeling one has on
coming home after journeying in strange lands, we
crossed from Roman Catholic France and Belgium into
Protestant Holland.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Making of Holland.</span></p>


<p class="right p2">
<span class="smcap">The Hague</span>, <i>October 22, 1902</i>.
</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">There</span> is an endless variety of interest in the different
countries of the Old World. Each has its own fascination
for travellers. But, after all, the strangest,
quaintest, cleanest and most picturesque country in
Europe is Holland&mdash;little, wet, flat, energetic, heroic
Holland. By calling it picturesque I do not mean that
nature has made it so. There are no bold cliffs overlooking
the sea, no heathery hills reflecting themselves
in placid lakes, no soaring mountains, forest-clad or snow-capped,
no waterfalls foaming and thundering among the
rocks. It is not what nature has done, but what man has
done, that makes Holland so picturesque. There is no
country on the globe for which nature has done so little
and man has done so much. By an energy and industry
unsurpassed in the annals of the world, the Dutchman
has wrested his land from the ocean itself, walling out
its wild waves with huge dykes, and has converted this
swamp into a blooming paradise, studded all over with
prosperous farms and opulent cities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Land below
Sea Level.</div>

<p>As the two most common names of this
country themselves suggest, <i>Holland</i> meaning
Hollow Land, and <i>Netherlands</i> meaning Lowlands,
the greater part of it is from twenty to thirty feet below
the level of the ocean; that is to say, the sea actually
rolls some ten yards higher than the ground on which the
people live. Hence the common remark, in which, however,
there is some exaggeration, that the frog, croaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
among the bulrushes, looks down upon the swallow on
the housetops, and that the ships float high above the
chimneys of the houses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water as
an Enemy.</div>

<p>Of course, then, there is the ever-present
danger that the ocean will break in and
again overspread all this fair territory where its waters
once rolled, and only by the most remarkable ingenuity,
the most incessant vigilance, and the most untiring industry
can it be prevented from doing so. Water is the immemorial
enemy of the Dutch. They are trained at college
to fight against water, as in other lands soldiers are
trained to fight against the human foes of their country.
They are compelled to wage a perpetual battle for their
very existence, for, as some one has expressed it, as soon
as they cease to pump they begin to drown. It costs the
Dutch people about six million dollars a year to keep their
country above water, or, to speak more accurately, to
keep the water above it. If one wishes to appreciate the
imminence of this danger, he has only to stand for a few
minutes at the foot of one of the great dykes on the coast,
at high tide, and listen to the waves dashing against the
outer side of the barrier, twenty feet above his head.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dykes as
Protectors.</div>

<p>Of course, the explanation of all this lies in
the fact that Holland is of alluvial formation.
Like Lower Egypt and some other regions at the
mouths of great rivers, it is a delta land, the soil of which
has been carried down from the interior by the Rhine
and deposited here, little by little, in the course of the
ages; so that Napoleon Bonaparte is said to have laid
claim to the country on the whimsical plea that it was
land robbed from other countries which were his by right
of conquest. Moreover this particular delta lies farther
below sea level than any other, Holland, as a whole, being
the lowest country in the world. These vast and costly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
embankments are therefore absolutely necessary to shut
the ocean out and keep it out. The Dutch proverb says,
"God made the sea, we made the shore."</p>

<p>But that is not all. In many places the dykes are no
less necessary to prevent the country from being overflowed
by the rivers, the beds of which have been gradually
raised by alluvial deposits, so that now the surface
of the water is considerably above the level of the surrounding
country, as is the case in our own land with
the Mississippi river at New Orleans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How Dykes
are made.</div>

<p>These huge ramparts, by which the sea has
been made to obey the command of Canute,
sometimes rise to a height of not less than thirty-six feet,
and rest upon massive foundations a hundred and fifty feet
wide. They are made of earth, sand and mud thoroughly
consolidated so as to be impervious to water, and the surface
is covered with interwoven willow twigs, the interstices
being filled with clay, and the whole thus bound
into a solid mass. Many of the dykes are planted with
trees, the roots of which help to bind the materials of
the structure more firmly together. Others are protected
by bulwarks of masonry or by stakes driven along the
sides, the surface being covered with turf.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sand Dunes.</div>

<p>In addition to the directly aggressive action
of the water, the sea has made trouble for
the Hollanders in another way. Along the coast, low
sand hills, from thirty to a hundred and fifty feet high,
have been thrown up by the action of the wind and the
waves, and, as these dunes, if left to themselves, are
continually changing their shape, shifting their position,
and scattering their loose sand over the fertile land adjacent,
the people, in order to prevent this, sow them annually
with reed-grass and other plants which will sprout
in such poor soil, and the roots, spreading and intertwining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in every direction, gradually consolidate the sand,
form a substratum of vegetable soil, and convert the arid
sand dunes into stable and productive agricultural regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Canals.</div>

<p>Having thus made his land by walling out
the sea and the rivers, and by anchoring
those portions of it which were too much disposed to
travel about, the Dutchman's next task was to provide
drains for removing the superfluous water from the cultivated
land, fences for enclosing the portion belonging to
each individual farmer and separating it from that of his
neighbor, and highways for communication and traffic
between the different parts of the country. By means of
canals he made the conquered water serve all three of
these purposes. The whole country is a network of canals,
which stretch their shining lengths in every direction,
and which are of all sizes, from the main thoroughfares,
sixty feet wide and six feet deep, along which glide the
great barges laden with merchandise and drawn by sedate
horses, down to the ditches of five or six feet which
mark the boundaries of separate farms or divide the fields
of each farmer from one another, canals being used in
this way as uniformly as hedges and fences are in other
lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Windmills.</div>

<p>Remembering, as already stated, that not
only the surface of the water, but the beds
of the larger canals are often considerably above the level
of the surrounding country, it will be seen that the
problem of drainage was not an easy one. The Dutch
solved it by making the wind work for them. On every
hand are seen windmills, larger and stronger here than
in any other country, swinging their huge arms, and
pumping up the superfluous water from the low lying
ground to the canals, which carry it to the sea. These
mills are used also for grinding grain, cutting tobacco,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
sawing timber, manufacturing paper, and many other
things for which we use water mills or steam mills.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Polders.</div>

<p>Of late, however, windmills have been to a
large extent superseded by steam engines for
purposes of drainage, especially in the making of polders,
as they call the marshes or lakes, the beds of which have
been reclaimed by draining. In this process, which is
still actively carried on by speculators, the morass or
lake to be drained is first enclosed with a dyke to prevent
the entrance of any water from without. Then the water
within is removed by means of peculiarly constructed
water-wheels, driven by steam engines. Sometimes the
lake is so deep that the water cannot be lifted directly
to the main canal, and thus be carried off, and when this
is the case a series of dykes and canals at different levels
has to be made, and the water transferred successively
from one to another. The land thus reclaimed is wonderfully
fertile, since in wet seasons superfluous water
can always be quickly removed, and in dry seasons thorough
irrigation can be effected still more easily and
quickly.</p>

<p>If these polders could be looked down upon from a
balloon, they would have a very artificial appearance,
something like gigantic checker-boards, as they have been
mapped out with mathematical precision, divided into
rectangular plots by straight canals and straight rows of
trees, and furnished with houses all built on exactly the
same pattern.</p>

<p>The most stupendous work of this kind ever projected
is the proposed construction of an embankment which
would convert the Zuider Zee into a vast lagoon, with
an area of 1,400 square miles, two-thirds of which could
be made into a polder. It is estimated that the work
would cost $75,000,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that this little nation, which
has accomplished such wonders in making its own land
and in keeping it from being swallowed up by the sea
after it was made, and which has in the past done such
great things for liberty and learning, for manufactures
and commerce, is still capable of great enterprises.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entering
Holland.</div>

<p>No boy or girl who has read <i>Hans Brinker
or the Silver Skates</i> can ever think of Holland
with indifference. No man or woman who has read
Motley's stirring history of the heroic little republic in
the Rhine delta can ever enter the Netherlands without
a feeling of the liveliest interest. No lover of liberty who
recalls the sufferings and services of the Dutch Calvinists
in the cause of freedom, and the glorious victory they
achieved against tremendous odds, can set foot on that
sacred soil without a thrill of reverent gratitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Scenery
and the Scenes.</div>

<p>Such were some of the memories with
which our hearts were warmed as our train
from Brussels began to cross the bridges over the broad
estuaries that make in from the sea through the low, flat
country, in the neighborhood of Dordrecht and Rotterdam,
and to run through an unmistakably Dutch landscape,
with bright green fields divided into rectangular
sections by hundreds of shining canals, and occupied by
innumerable herds of black and white Holstein cattle,
not a few of them actually wearing jackets, apparently
made of burlaps or bagging, to protect them from the
dampness; with level roads running along the tops of the
dykes several yards above the surrounding country, and
sedate looking horses drawing old-fashioned wagons, and
brisk looking dogs drawing clattering milk carts, with
their cargo of burnished cans; with innumerable rows
of willow trees, the twigs of which the people use to make
the covering of the dykes, and the wood of which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
use to make their heavy, pointed shoes, or sabots; with
picturesque houses roofed with red tiles, and broad-built
peasants working in the fields, wearing those same wooden
sabots, and clean looking market women trudging into
the towns in their exceedingly picturesque head-dress of
gold helmets covered with lace caps; with stiff, symmetrical
gardens, and trees clipped into fantastic shapes;
with quaint old church steeples and gilded weather-cocks;
and ever and anon a weather-beaten windmill swinging
its great arms between us and the low horizon. This was
Holland, beyond a doubt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rotterdam.</div>

<p>An interesting indication of the important
part played by the dykes in the development
of Holland is the number of towns which have been named
from the dyke or dam originally built on a site, such
as Rotterdam, Schiedam, Amsterdam, and so on. The
first important place we passed was Rotterdam, the most
active seaport of Holland, with a population of three hundred
and twenty thousand, and from the high railway
bridge on which we crossed the Maas we had a good
view of the boompjes, as they call the magnificent quays,
which, with their graceful fringe of trees and their tangled
forest of shipping, line the banks of the river for a mile
and a half. We caught a glimpse also of the bronze
statue of Erasmus, the Dutch scholar, who, as some say,
"laid the egg which Luther hatched." On a former visit
to Rotterdam I had seen the birthplace of this illustrious
man, bearing on its front the inscription, "<i>Haec est parva
domus, magnus qua natus Erasmus</i>" (<i>this is the little
house in which great Erasmus was born</i>.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hague.</div>

<p>Leaving Rotterdam, we pass on our left
Delftshaven, from which a party of the Pilgrim
Fathers sailed to America in 1620; then Schiedam,
noted for its "schnapps," of which there are more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
two hundred distilleries; then Delft, where William the
Silent, the immortal founder of Dutch independence, was
assassinated by a Jesuit whom the Roman Catholic persecutors
of the Netherlands had hired to rid them of
their great foeman, but which, I fear, is better known
to some of my readers as the place where a certain blue-glazed
earthenware used to be made in imitation of
Chinese porcelain; and then, fifteen miles from Rotterdam,
The Hague, one of the handsomest towns in Holland,
with the Royal Palace, and in a lovely park outside
the city the royal villa, called The House in the Wood,
and two miles away on the sea the fashionable watering-place
of Scheveningen, and in the city itself scrupulously
clean and bright houses on every hand, where its two
hundred thousand people live, and, above all, the picture
gallery, with its two world-renowned paintings by Rembrandt
and Potter, to say nothing of others scarcely inferior,
if at all so, such as Vermeer's "View of Delft," with
its red and blue roofs partly lit up with yellow sunlight,
a simple view which "is perhaps unmatched by any other
landscape in the world for the truthfulness of its atmospheric
and light effects and for the vigor and brilliance
of its coloring." Paul Potter's "Young Bull" is a marvellous
picture, but the one which demands and repays
the longest study is Rembrandt's "School of Anatomy,"
which shows us the celebrated Nicolaas Tulp, in black
coat, lace collar and broad-brimmed soft hat, explaining
the anatomy of the arm of a corpse to a body of surgeons,
who listen to the lecture with the most life-like expressions,
and which has been happily characterized as the
truest and most life-like representation of the "working
of intellect" ever produced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Presbyterian
Government.</div>

<p>As we had reminded ourselves when visiting
the royal residences that the young and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
beloved Queen Wilhelmina is the only Presbyterian Queen
in the world, so we reminded ourselves when visiting the
Chambers of the States General that Holland is the only
country in the world which has the good fortune to have
a Presbyterian preacher for its Prime Minister. Of
course, other countries have Presbyterian laymen for
prime ministers, Mr. Balfour of Great Britain, for example,
but Holland is the only one that has placed the
helm of the state in the hands of a preacher. His name
is the Rev. Dr. Abraham Kuyper, and he is one of the
ablest and most versatile men in the world. His recent
book on <i>The Holy Spirit</i> is the greatest monograph on
that subject that has appeared since the work of John
Owen. He has rendered a great service to the cause of
vital religion in checking the rationalistic views of such
men as Professor Kuenen, and strongly reasserting the
evangelical doctrines to which Holland has been so deeply
indebted in the past for the heroic character of her people,
and the glorious position she holds in the history of human
freedom. Though the Chambers were not in session when
we visited the Binnenhof, we took special pleasure in
having even the chair of Dr. Kuyper pointed out to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unpresbyterian
Church
Buildings.</div>

<p>By the way, the cathedrals and other great
churches of Holland erected before the
Reformation strikingly illustrate how unfit
such structures are for Christian worship, according to
the simple New Testament model, especially for preaching
the gospel. They are adapted only to the spectacular
ceremonies of the Roman Catholics and other ritualists.
Therefore, any Protestant community which has had the
misfortune to inherit a cathedral from the unreformed
period has an elephant on its hands. The Dutch people,
being mostly Presbyterians, have had this experience, and,
finding themselves unable to make the most effective use
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of these great buildings erected for Romish rites, have
allowed them to assume a very unattractive, dreary and
barn-like appearance on the inside.</p>

<p>The question may shock our æsthetic friends, but,
notwithstanding the incalculable loss to art, would it not
have been better for the world if the Protestant countries
at the time of the Reformation had macadamized all their
cathedrals? And if any one hesitates to answer in the
affirmative, let him consider carefully the connection between
the modes of worship, and the character of the
worshipper, and let him explain to himself clearly why
it is that the countries which have adopted the Protestant
model, with its steady appeal to the reason, and its earnest
insistence upon intelligent apprehension of the truth, are
the cleanest, safest, thriftiest and strongest countries in
the world, while those which have adopted the Romish
model, with its constant appeal to the æsthetic sensibilities,
and its millinery, music, processions, incense, and "vain
repetitions," are precisely the countries which have suffered
the greatest material and moral deterioration, and
which were not long ago contemptuously characterized
by Lord Salisbury, the late Premier of Great Britain, as
"decaying nations."</p>

</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> gave only one day to Leyden, ten miles from The
Hague, but it was one of the most interesting
days we have had in Europe. Taking a guide at the
railway station, we traversed the quaint streets and
crossed and recrossed the multitudinous canals, and
climbed to the top of the great fortified circular mound
of earth in the centre of the city, called the <i>Burg</i>, the
foundations of which date from the tenth century, and
from the top of which we had a unique view of the heroic
old town and the peaceful homes of its fifty-four thousand
people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great Siege.</div>

<p>But one does not go far in Leyden without
being reminded of the terrible siege to
which it was subjected by the Spaniards in 1574. One
such reminder is the bronze statue of the gallant Mayor
Van der Werf, who defended the city in that siege and
would listen to no suggestion of surrender. Another is
an inscription on the front of the Stadhuis, which, translated,
reads: "When the black famine had brought to
the death nearly six thousand persons, then God the Lord
repented and gave us bread again as much as we could
wish"; and which in the original Dutch is an ingenious
chronogram, the capital letters as Roman numerals giving
the date, and the one hundred and thirty-one letters used
in the original indicating the number of days during
which the siege lasted. But, after a short and partial
relief, the siege was continued in the form of a blockade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
for many dreadful months. William of Orange finally
cut the dykes and flooded the country, and relieved the
famished city by ships.</p>

  <div class="caption">A STRANGER IN LEYDEN.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A Unique Reward
of Valor.</div>

<p>The story of Leyden which made the deepest
impression upon me as a boy was that of
William's offering to reward the citizens for this gallant
defence either by exempting them from taxes for a certain
number of years or by the establishment of a university
in their city. To their everlasting honor they chose the
latter, even in that time of distress and poverty, and the
University was founded in 1575. Of course we wished
to see the University which had such a history as that,
to say nothing of the fact that we had heard of Leyden
jars ever since we began the study of electricity at college,
and that we knew something of a few of the men whose
genius has at different periods since made the faculty one
of the most illustrious in Europe, such as "the learned
Scaliger," the famous physician Boerhaave, Arminius and
Gomar, champions, respectively, of the two theological
schools known as Arminians or Remonstrants and Calvinists,
which in 1618 brought their differences to debate
in the famous Synod of Dort; and, as is always the case
when an opportunity for thorough discussion on the basis
of Scripture is given, the result was a victory for the
Calvinists. We remembered also with pleasure that
Oliver Goldsmith, author of the immortal <i>Vicar of Wakefield</i>,
was for a time a student at the University of Leyden;
and we recalled with less pleasure that in our own day
the faculty of the institution had furnished one of the
boldest advocates of the destructive criticism of the Old
Testament, Professor Abraham Kuenen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plain College
Buildings
Abroad.</div>

<p>It was a satisfaction to see it, though there
is little to see; this University, like most
of those on the continent, having very indifferent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
buildings and appointments. The men who sometimes
"kick" in American colleges and seminaries because
the class-rooms and dormitories do not suit them, to say
nothing of their board, would get a superabundance of
that sort of exercise if they had to attend the average
Dutch or German university. In fact, it has been intimated
at times that there are men in American colleges
and seminaries who belong to that class of people of whom
it was suggested that they would grumble even after getting
to heaven on the ground that their haloes didn't fit.
Fortunately, however, these are very few, the great majority
of our American students being not spoiled and
fussy children, but manly, sensible, hard working, plain
living, high thinking men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">John Robinson
and the Pilgrim
Fathers.</div>

<p>Before leaving Leyden we made a point of
visiting the house in which the Rev. John
Robinson lived. He was the leader of the
first Puritans who were banished from England, and who,
like the adherents of every other persecuted faith, found
toleration and liberty in Calvinistic Holland. A bronze
tablet affixed to the wall of the church on the opposite
side of the street contains a bas-relief of the <i>Mayflower</i>,
and states that it was at Mr. Robinson's prompting that
the Pilgrim Fathers went forth to settle New England
in 1620.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horse Flesh
as Food.</div>

<p>As we passed with our guide through what
looked like an open-air beef market, he surprised
us not a little by telling us that what the people
were buying there was not beef, but horse flesh, which is
much cheaper, adding that the worn-out dray horses and
car horses of the English cities were regularly bought
and shipped to Holland to be sold to the poor instead of
beef. No doubt the people of Leyden became accustomed
to much worse fare than that when, during the great siege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of 1574, the Spaniards were trying to starve them into
resubmission to Roman Catholicism. But those conditions
no longer exist, and the idea of eating horse flesh as a
regular thing is not one which commends itself to our
feelings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Haarlem.</div>

<p>This place, seventeen miles from Leyden,
also had experience of the tender mercies of
the papal soldiery when, in 1573, after a gallant defence of
seven months, it fell into the hands of the Spaniards, and
the entire garrison, the Protestant ministers of the gospel,
and two thousand of the townspeople were executed.
Haarlem is now, and has been for two hundred and fifty
years, famous for its horticulture. It supplies bulbs to
every part of the world, and in the spring the nurseries
around the city are ablaze with the brilliant blooms of
the tulips, hyacinths, crocuses and lilies, whole fields of
them in every variety of color, like vast natural flags of
the brightest hues, lying on the flat surface of the country,
and the whole atmosphere is impregnated with their delicious
fragrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Flower
Boom.</div>

<p>Two centuries and a half ago, at the time
of the "Tulip Mania," there was as wild
speculation in bulbs as there has ever been in our day
in stocks. Enormous prices were paid for the rarer bulbs.
For instance, a single bulb of the species called "Semper
Augustus" was sold for five thousand two hundred dollars.
This statement will not seem incredible to any of
my readers who have had bitter experience with the
fictitious values created by the "booms" which cursed and
crippled so many of our Southern communities a few
years ago. The tulip craze in Holland had the same
history: the mania subsided, the prices fell, many of the
speculators were ruined, and before long a "Semper
Augustus" could be bought for twenty dollars. Even that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
will seem to most people a pretty high price for a single
tulip bulb.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Small
Country.</div>

<p>We did not stop at Haarlem, as it was not
the right season for the gorgeous display of
flowers above referred to, that is, the latter part of April
and the beginning of May, but pushed on to Amsterdam,
which is only ten miles away. If the reader has taken
account of the distances between these populous cities as
they have been successively mentioned, and has observed
how short they are, he will have received a very strong
impression of the smallness of the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amsterdam.</div>

<p>Amsterdam, the largest city in Holland,
with a population of more than half a million,
is built upon nearly a hundred islands, separated
from one another by a network of canals and connected
by means of some three hundred bridges, and is, therefore,
sometimes spoken of as "a vulgar Venice," but, with its
prodigious vitality, its crowded streets, its busy waters,
and its financial eminence, it must be far more like the
Venice which was Queen of the Adriatic some centuries
ago than the stagnant and melancholy town which bears
that name to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Odoriferous
Canals.</div>

<p>The water in the canals is about three feet
deep, and below this is a layer of mud of
the same thickness. It is said that, in order to prevent
malarial exhalations, the water is constantly renewed from
an arm of the North Sea Canal and the mud removed by
dredging. I hope this process is effective, but there
were unmistakable exhalations from the canals when we
were there. Whether they were malarial or not I cannot
say, but certainly they were unfragrant to a degree. Still,
the evil smells of Amsterdam are not to be named in
number and vigor with those of Venice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A City Built
on Stakes.</div>

<p>As in Venice, so here, all the houses are built
on piles which are driven fifteen or twenty
feet through the loose sand near the surface into the firmer
layers below. Hence the jest of Erasmus, that he knew
a city whose inhabitants dwelt on the tops of trees like
rooks. They are not so secure on their perch, however,
as the rooks. For, although the preparations underground
are often more costly than the buildings afterwards
erected above, yet, such is the difficulty of securing a
firm foundation, and such the ravages of the wood worm
among the fir-tree piles after they are driven into the sand
and built upon, that many of the brick houses which were
once erect are now considerably out of the perpendicular,
and lean backwards or forwards or sideways, according
as the piles have given way at one place or another. In
1822 thirty-four hundred tons of grain were stored in a
grain magazine originally built for the East India Company,
and, the piles being unable to sustain the weight,
the building literally sank down into the mud.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Business
of Amsterdam.</div>

<p>Besides its importance as a mart for the
tobacco, sugar, rice, spices, and other produce
of the Dutch colonies in the East Indies, West Indies
and South America (which, by the way, have a population
of thirty-five million, that is, seven times as many
as the little mother country), Amsterdam has a number
of important industrial establishments, such as ship-yards,
sugar and camphor refineries, cobalt-blue and candle factories,
machine shops, breweries, and especially diamond-polishing
mills, of which last there are no less than
seventy, employing in all about ten thousand men. We
visited one of these mills and watched the process for a
few minutes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Jewish
Quarter.</div>

<p>The art of polishing diamonds was introduced
here in the sixteenth century by Portuguese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
Jews, who, driven from their former homes by
papal persecution, found in Protestant Holland an asylum,
and, like the oppressed adherents of other creeds, secured
the full religious toleration which they craved. They have
ever since constituted an important part of the population
of Amsterdam, and now number about thirty-five thousand.
One of the interesting episodes of our visit was a
drive through the poorer Jewish Quarter, with its swarms
of untidy men, women and children. In this quarter and
of this stock Spinoza, the philosopher, was born; and in
this quarter, though not of this stock, Rembrandt, the
painter, lived for fifteen years, in a house marked by a
tablet, which those who are specially interested in art
always wish to see.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Home of President
Kruger.</div>

<p>Utrecht, twenty-two miles from Amsterdam,
is an attractive city of one hundred
thousand inhabitants. It interested us chiefly as the centre
of the Jansenists, the redoubtable Roman Catholic adversaries
of the Jesuits, and as the peaceful home of ex-President
Kruger since his withdrawal from the stormy
experiences of his life in South Africa. This venerable
man, so remarkable on account of his public career, is of
special interest to any one connected with Union Seminary
in Virginia, because it was under the ministry of a
former student of our Seminary, the late Dr. Daniel Lindley,
who went as a missionary to South Africa more than
sixty years ago, that Mr. Kruger was brought into the
church. He lives in great comfort on the famous Malieban,
which, with its triple row of lime trees, is one of
the loveliest residential districts in Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Queer Customs
in Holland.</div>

<p>It seems odd that in a country where there
is so much water, there should be so little
that is fit to drink, and that in a country where land is so
valuable the people should use any part of it for fuel,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
and yet, not only does one constantly see dog-carts containing
barrels of fresh water and loads of peat passing
hither and thither in the towns, but at cellar doors in
the side streets sign-boards are seen announcing "water
and fire to sell," and at these places the poorer classes
buy the boiling water or red-hot turf that they need to
make their tea or coffee. Foot-warmers are very generally
used by the Dutch women, and in some of the
churches we saw immense numbers of these little fireboxes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Comfort of
a Hot Water
Bottle.</div>

<p>This reminds me to say, for the benefit of
any of my readers who may be planning a
trip to Europe, that two things are more
conducive to comfort and health than a good hot-water
bottle when one is travelling in Northern or Central
Europe, for these lands are much colder than ours in
spring, summer and autumn, and arrangements for heating
the hotels either do not exist or are utterly ineffective.
American tourists who do not observe this precaution are
likely to need physic, and, by the way, the universal sign
for drug stores in Holland is not the mortar and pestle,
but "the gaper," that is, a painted Turk's head showing
his tongue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Domestic
Store-rooms
in the Top
Stories.</div>

<p>In Amsterdam and other Dutch cities many
of the houses, which are made of brick with
light colored painting and have a very substantial
and neat appearance, are narrow
and high, standing with ornamented gable ends to the
street, and have beams projecting from the gables with
fixtures for hoisting goods to the top stories, which are
used for store-rooms. These are not business houses, but
dwelling houses of people well to do, and the windows
and woodwork from top to bottom are scrupulously clean
and bright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Original
"Spotless
Town."</div>

<p>Broeck, in the north of Holland, is said to
be the original Spotless Town. We did
not visit this place, but it is thus described
by a writer in <i>Public Opinion</i> who has done so:</p>

<p>"The palings of the fences of Broeck are sky-blue.
The streets are paved with shining bricks of many colors.
The houses are rose-colored, black, gray, purple, light
blue or pale green. The doors are painted and gilded.
For hours you may not see a soul in the streets or at the
windows. The streets and houses, bridges, windows and
barns show a neatness and a brilliancy that are absolutely
painful.</p>

<p>"At every step a new effect is disclosed, a new scene
is beheld, as if painted upon the drop-curtain of a stage.
Everything is minute, compact, painted, spotless and clean.
In the houses of Broeck for cleaning purposes you will
find big brooms, little brooms, tooth-brushes, aqua fortis,
whiting for the window panes, rouge for the forks and
spoons, coal dust for the copper, emery for the iron utensils,
brick powder for the floors, and even small splinters
of wood with which to pick out the tiny bits of straw in
the cracks between the bricks. Here are some of the rules
of this wonderful town:</p>

<p>"Citizens must leave their shoes at the door when
entering a house.</p>

<p>"Before or after sunset no one is allowed to smoke
excepting with a pipe having a cover, so that the ashes
will not be scattered upon the street.</p>

<p>"Any one crossing the village on horseback must get
out of the saddle and lead the horse.</p>

<p>"A cuspidor shall be kept by the front door of each
house.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to cross the village in a carriage, or to
drive animals through the streets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, it appears that "Spotless Town" is not merely
an ideal existing in the imagination of the man who writes
the very clever verses placarded in our street-cars and
elsewhere in praise of the cleansing properties of Sapolio,
but a reality; and there are numerous places in Holland
which in point of cleanliness would put to shame any of
our American towns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Pardonable
Mania.</div>

<p>Some one has said that the Dutch love of
cleanliness amounts almost to a monomania,
and that the washing, scrubbing and polishing to which
every house is subjected once every week is rather subversive
of comfort. And it would appear from the regulations
above cited that the matter is sometimes pushed to
extremes. But my experience as a traveller in some parts
of my own country, as well as in some parts of other
lands, has made me very tolerant of such a mania as that,
and, when amid the filth of Venice or Naples, for instance,
my mind has reverted to these clean Dutch towns, it has
caused me to sigh&mdash;"<i>O si sic omnes!</i>"</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mr. Edward
Bok on the
"Mother of
America."</div>

<p>I cannot resist the temptation to append to
these letters about little, quaint, clean, energetic,
heroic, learned, unpretentious Holland
some extracts from an article of Mr. Edward
Bok's which I have read since my return to America.
He refers to the fact that twenty thousand more American
travellers are said to have visited the Netherlands during
the past summer than in any previous year, and to the
fact that there is a rapidly increasing demand for books
on the history of the Dutch people, as shown by the
reports of the librarians in American towns, and he
regards these as specimens of a group of facts which,
taken together, indicate clearly that the reading world
of America is beginning to appreciate the real extent of
the strong Dutch influences which underlie American institutions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
and have shaped American life. He says that
for years we have written in our histories and taught in
our schools that this nation is a transplanted England;
that the institutions which have made this country distinctively
great were derived from England. But he
denies that England is entitled to this honor, and declares
that the true mother land of America is not England, but
Holland:</p>

<p>"Take, for instance, what may be truly designated as
the four vital institutions upon which America not only
rests, but which have caused it to be regarded as the most
distinctive nation in the world. I mean our public-school
system of free education; our freedom of religious worship;
our freedom of the press; and our freedom of
suffrage as represented by the secret ballot. Not one of
these came from England, since not one of them existed
there when they were established in America; in fact,
only one of them existed in England earlier than fifty
years after they existed in America, and the other three
did not exist in England until nearly one hundred years
after their establishment in America. Each and all of
these four institutions came to America directly from
Holland. Take the two documents upon which the whole
fabric of the establishment and maintenance of America
rests&mdash;the Declaration of Independence and the Federal
Constitution of the United States&mdash;and one, the Declaration,
is based almost entirely upon the Declaration of Independence
of the United Republic of the Netherlands;
while all through the Constitution its salient points are
based upon, and some literally copied from, the Dutch
Constitution. So strong is this Netherland influence upon
our American form of government that the Senate of
the United States, as a body, derives most of the peculiarities
of its organization from the Netherlands States
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
General, a similar body, and its predecessor by nearly a
century of years, while even in the American flag we find
the colors and the five-pointed star chosen from the Dutch.</p>

<p>"The common modern practice of the State allowing
a prisoner the free services of a lawyer for his defence,
and the office of a district attorney for each county, are
so familiar to us that we regard them as American inventions.
Both institutions have been credited to England,
whereas, as a matter of fact, it is impossible to find in
England even to-day any official corresponding to our
district attorney. Both of these institutions existed in
Holland three centuries before they were brought to
America.</p>

<p>"The equal distribution of property among the children
of a person dying intestate&mdash;that is, without a
will&mdash;was brought to America direct from Holland by
the Puritans. It never existed in England.</p>

<p>"The record of all deeds and mortgages in a public
office, a custom which affects every man and woman who
owns or buys property, came to America direct from
Holland. It never came from England, since it does not
exist there even at the present day.</p>

<p>"The township system, by which each town has local
self-government, with its natural sequence of local self-government
in county and State, came from Holland.</p>

<p>"The practice of making prisoners work, and turning
prisons into workhouses, and, in fact, our whole modern
American management of free prisons which has caused
the admiration of the entire world, was brought from
Holland to America by William Penn.</p>

<p>"Group these astonishing facts together, if you will,
and see their tremendous import: The Federal Constitution;
the Declaration of Independence; the whole organization
of the Senate; our State Constitutions; our freedom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
of religion; our free schools; our free press; our
written ballot; our town, county and State systems of
self-government; the system of recording deeds and mortgages;
the giving of every criminal a just chance for
his life; a public prosecutor of crime in every county;
our free prison workhouse system&mdash;to say nothing of
kindred important and vital elements in our national life.
When each and all of these can be traced directly to one
nation, or to the influence of that nation, and that nation
not England, is it any wonder, asks one enlightened historian,
that some modern scholars, who, looking beneath
the mere surface resemblance of language, seek an explanation
of the manifest difference between the people
of England and the people of the United States assumed
by them to be of the same blood, and influenced by the
same (?) institutions?</p>

<p>"Nor is it strange that so strong a Dutch influence
should have entered into the establishment and making of
America, when one considers the immense debt which
the world owes to Holland. For it may be said without
fear of contradiction that in nearly every art which uplifts
and adorns human life, in nearly every aspect of human
endeavor, Holland has not only added to the moral resources
of mankind and contributed more to the fabric
of civilization, but has also actually led the way. It was
the first nation to master the soil and teach agriculture
to the world. It has taught the world the art of gardening.
It taught commerce and merchandise to the entire
world when it ranked as the only great commercial nation
on the globe. It taught the broadest lines of finance to
the world by the establishment, in 1609, of its great Bank
of Amsterdam, with one hundred and eighty millions of
dollars deposits, preceding the establishment of the Bank
of England by nearly one hundred years. The founding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
of its great University of Leyden, in 1575, marked an
epoch in the world's history of education, and made the
Netherlands the centre of learning of Europe. Here was
founded international law through Grotius, one of Holland's
greatest sons. Here Boerhaave, a Dutchman, revolutionized
medicine by his wonderful discoveries until
Holland's medical school became the seat of authority
for all Europe. From this centre, too, came that great
lesson in the publishing of books in the shape of the
famous Elzevir books. It was the first nation to place
the reader and the spelling-book in the hands of the child,
irrespective of station or means. As musicians, for nearly
two hundred years the Netherlands stood supreme, and
furnished all the courts of Europe with vocal and instrumental
music. It was the Dutch who founded, in Naples,
the first musical conservatory in the world, and another
in Venice, and it was to their influence and example that
the renowned school of Rome owed its existence.</p>

<p>"The starting of all these masterful influences would
alone make a nation great. But these were only a part of
Holland's wonderful contributions to the world's enlightenment.
It went on and introduced to the world
the manufacture of woollen cloth that marked an epoch
in history, and followed this up by developing the manufacture
of silk, linen, tapestry and lace until it made its
city of Flanders the manufacturing centre of the world.
It devised and presented through the Van Eyck brothers
the wonderful discovery of oil painting, and revolutionized
the world of art, and gave, in the person of one of
these brothers, Jan Van Eyck, the originator of the painted
portrait. Then came the invention of wood-engraving
by a Dutchman, followed quickly by the printing of books
from blocks; the substitution of movable type for the
solid block of wood, and we have the printing-press&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
invention of which Germany may never concede to Holland,
and yet the germ of which lay in the block books
to which Holland lays unquestioned claim. But Holland
need never squabble over a single invention. A nation
that, in addition to what has been cited above, has likewise
invented the telescope, the microscope, the thermometer,
the method of measuring degrees of latitude and longitude,
the pendulum clock, thereby putting before the
world the beginning of anything which we can call accuracy
in time, and discovered the capillary circulation of
the blood, need not stop to split straws.</p>

<p>There is a wonderful charm in reading the history
of a people who have done so much toward the enlightenment
of the world, and not alone in one field of thought
or activity, but in every field of human endeavor. The
people of no nation make so bold and strong an impression
on the mind as one after another of their achievements
pass before one, and especially when it is considered
that all these contributions to humankind were done with
one hand while the other was busy in saving every foot
of land from the rushing waters. But the people always
remained cool, balanced and solid. That same patient but
deep, perfervid spirit which built the dykes and saved
the land with one hand, and opened those same dykes,
built by the very life-blood of the people, with the other,
and flooded the land against encroaching enemies&mdash;that
same spirit built up a nation unrivalled in history as a
financial, commercial, maritime, art, learning, medical and
political centre, from which have radiated the strongest
influences for the upbuilding of great empires&mdash;not only
in the new Western world of America, but also in the
far East of the Indies, and in the strong colonial establishment
of South Africa. Her glory may be of the past,
but he is indeed a rash prophet who would predict the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
future of any nation, however small, on the face of the
globe of to-day. Of some things the American traveller
is to-day constantly convinced: that there is less intellectual
veneer in Holland than in any other country in
Europe; that there is more solid and abiding culture of
the very highest kind, and that the modern Dutch family
represents a repose of mind, a simplicity of living, and
a contented happiness with life in general that we, as a
nation, might well envy."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Up the Rhine and Over the Alps.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Cologne Cathedral is the finest Gothic structure
in the world. We had a perfect view of the majestic
exterior from the windows of our hotel, but, of
course, devoted most of our time to the still more impressive
interior. It is no part of my purpose to descant
upon these things which are described in all the books
of travel. The city possesses other objects of interest
besides its matchless cathedral, and some of them we
visited, in spite of the weather. It was cold and wet,
and we did not prolong our stay. But no conditions of
weather could have deterred us from taking the steamer
for our trip up the Rhine, rather than the railroad. It
was late in the season. The summer tourists had long
since returned to their homes in England and America.
We had the boat pretty much to ourselves. We could
hardly have fallen upon a worse day for the first half of
our trip. It was not only cold, but foggy, and we could
get only tantalizing glimpses of the shores now and then
when the mist thinned a little. So it continued nearly all
the way to Coblentz, where we landed and spent the night.
We comforted ourselves, however, with the reflection that
the finest scenery was farther up, and with the hope that
we should have a better day for that part of the trip.
And we had. The mist was rolling away rapidly when
we rose next morning, and it soon disappeared, leaving
us a fine autumn day. After listening to the exhilarating
music of a military band which was serenading a young
general near our hotel and after taking a look at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
noble statue of William I., and at the massive fortifications
of Ehrenbreitstein, the German Gibraltar, on the other
side of the river, we took the boat in better spirits, addressed
ourselves with more zest than before to the volume
of <i>Legends of the Rhine</i>, and thus began a delightful and
memorable day.</p>

<p>The chief advantage of making this celebrated trip
at this season is that one thus gets the opportunity to
see the vintage of the Rhine Valley as it can be seen at
no other season.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse">For miles the gorgeous vintage blazed."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Though, as a matter of fact, I believe that most of the
Rhine grapes that we saw were white. The steep slopes
of the hills among which the great river winds are covered
with vineyards, the vines in rows as regular as ranks
of Indian corn, and laden with millions of luscious
bunches. The vintagers, men, women and children, in
picturesque costumes and with huge baskets on their
backs, were busy everywhere stripping the fruit from
the yellow vines. The soil is kept in place by stone terraces.
Above the line of the vineyards jut out the huge
rocks of the mountains, their gray bastions alternating
with forests robed in green, brown, red and yellow, and
standing out boldly against the pure blue sky.</p>

<p>It is only by strong self-restraint that I can pass without
special notice such a rock as Rhinestein, such a town
as Bingen, and such a monument as that to "Germania"
on the Niederwald, but it must be done.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wiesbaden and
the German
Woods.</div>

<p>Wiesbaden, the most charming of German
watering-places, is a clean and handsome
city, with broad and well paved streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
many attractive shops and pleasant residences, excellent
hotels, extensive and lovely parks, a sumptuous opera
house, a less costly but very spacious music hall (where,
by the way, we had the pleasure of hearing Frau Shuman-Heink
sing), and a few large and costly churches, but
with no adequate arrangements, so far as I could see, for
the churching of its large population. The place owes its
importance primarily to the Boiling Salt Springs, which
here gush from the earth, and which have made this the
great resort for rheumatics and the victims of various
other ailments. It is also the home of one of the most
celebrated oculists in Europe, whose patients come to him
from every part of the world. The chief attraction for
those who are fond of outdoor life is the glorious forests
which stretch from Wiesbaden back through the valleys
and over the Taunus Mountains. One of our young
people has just been writing to the folks at home about
an eighteen-mile walk through these woods, guided only
by the blazed trees, and speaks with pardonable enthusiasm
of "the blue-gray trunks outlined against the terra
cotta carpet of fallen leaves, the sunlight glancing through
the trees, and the gently waving branches against the
azure sky. There is no undergrowth as in our forests
at home, but there are here and there gray rocks, large
and small, covered with fresh green moss, or with gray,
pink and yellow lichen. There were rustic benches all
along, but the forest was quite deserted except for an
occasional woodman with a fire and piles of neatly
chopped wood, or some little boys drawing carts filled
with bundles of sticks for winter use."</p>

<p>We spent three weeks at wholesome Wiesbaden,
counting a day that we gave to
Mayence, on the other side of the Rhine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
for the purpose of seeing the memorials of Gutenberg,
the inventor of printing. Then we took the train for
Worms. The chief "lion" here is, of course, the magnificent
Luther monument, a thing which no visitor to
this part of the world should fail to see. Recrossing the
Rhine, we ran up to Heidelberg, and devoted a day to
the fine old castle and the famous university&mdash;a stinging
cold day it was, too. Nor did winter relax his grip at
Strasburg, for there we had snow. One of the youngsters
celebrated his birthday there by watching the noon performances
of the world-renowned clock in the old Cathedral,
our whole party going with him, the adults watching
the wonderful mechanism with scarcely less interest than
the children. The striking of that clock and the movements
of its various figures and fixtures at twelve o'clock
every day invariably draws a large crowd of people. We
saw the storks' nests on the chimneys, too, but of course
the storks themselves were down in the warm sunshine
of Africa at that season.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Switzerland in
Winter-time.</div>

<p>Switzerland caps the climax of scenic interest
in Europe&mdash;lakes, waterfalls, mountains,
glaciers&mdash;language and pictures are alike unavailing
to convey an adequate impression of this sublime
scenery. My first views of it were in midsummer. On
the 31st of July, 1896, at the top of the Wengern Alp,
seven thousand feet above the sea, reached by rail all the
way, my travelling companions and I had coasted on sleds
over the snow like boys, wearing our heavy overcoats
the while. Above us rose the Jungfrau, six thousand
feet higher, piercing the clouds. As we watched, the
clouds parted, and the white Jungfrau, wearing the dazzling
Silberhorn on her bosom, burst upon our view.
Never shall we see anything more beautiful till our eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
rest upon the pinnacles of the celestial city. We were
standing at the time on the Eiger Glacier, an immense
mass of pale green ice covered with a snowy crust. Longfellow
somewhere (in "Hyperion," I think) likens the
shape of one of the glaciers to a glove, lying with the
palm downwards. "It is a gauntlet of ice, which centuries
ago Winter, the king of these mountains, threw down
in defiance to the Sun, and year by year the Sun strives
in vain to lift it from the ground on the point of his
glittering spear." Aye, in vain. Winter is king. But
the Sun now and then wrenches somewhat from his grasp.
And even while we gazed speechless at the unearthly
splendor of the Jungfrau and the Silberhorn we heard
an avalanche fall with a crash like the end of the world.
That night we sat before a roaring fire and wrote home
about it.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE LION OF LUCERNE.</div>
</div>

<p>That was my experience in midsummer. Now we
were to see not only the great mountain tops, but the
whole country, in the undisputed grasp of Winter. When
we reached Lucerne, not only the high Alps, but all the
mountains and hills, far as the eye could reach, were covered
with snow. When we visited Thorwaldsen's celebrated
Lion of Lucerne we found workmen with scaffolding
and ladders against the cliff, carefully boxing it in
with boards to prevent it from being injured by the freezing
of water trickling down upon it during the winter
now at hand. But we were in time, just in time, to see
it, and we all agreed that few monuments in Europe are
so impressive. The great figure, twenty-eight feet in
length, I believe, carved in the living rock, represents the
king of beasts lying slain, pierced by an arrow, with
broken spear and shield beneath, and over that shield,
which bears the lilies of France, the huge paws are
thrown, as if guarding it still in death. It commemorates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the devotion of the Swiss guard who, in 1792, were appointed
to keep the palace at Versailles, and receiving no
orders to retire, preferred to die at their post rather than
betray their trust. The glacier gardens near by, with
their ingenious and realistic illustration of the action of
the falling water in grinding the boulders in the glacier
pots, interested us greatly. We paid some attention to the
shops also, and the old cathedral, and the quaint old
bridges. But we did not tarry long at Lucerne. It was
too cold. We took the steamer down the lake, though,
cold as it was, for we had no idea of missing entirely
the magnificent scenery which gives this body of water
easy preëminence among the Swiss lakes. We spent the
night, bitter cold, at Fluelen, then took the fastest train
we could get for Milan, only to meet there another disappointment
in the matter of the weather.</p>


<p class="right">

<div class="sidenote">Italy Gives
us Little
Relief.</div>

<p>We had seen the ice floating in great blocks
down the Neckar at Heidelberg, and had
felt the stinging winds on the hills above
the old castle; we had stamped our feet on the stone floors
of the cathedral at Strasburg to renew the circulation
in our benumbed extremities while waiting for the crowing
of the rooster and the marching of the puppets, and
the striking of the bells on the famous clock; we had
seen vast fields of snow covering the Alps in every direction
as we passed through Switzerland, and had shivered
in the searching cold as we steamed down Lake Lucerne,
unable to tear ourselves from the glorious beauty that
lay open to our view on every hand from the steamer's
decks; we had caught the wintry glitter of gigantic icicles
against the cliffs on either side as our train climbed the
wild St. Gothard pass&mdash;and, in short, we had had a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
surfeit of cold weather, and for days and weeks we had
been sighing for Sunny Italy. Imagine our disappointment,
then, when we emerged from the Alps and entered
the land of balmy climate and blue skies (as most of us
had always ignorantly thought it to be even in winter)
to find the whole world still white around us, to run along
the side of Lake Lugano and Lake Como in a whirling
snow-storm, and to arrive at Milan in a fog so thick that
it looked like it could be cut into blocks, so opaque that at
times we could not see the mighty Cathedral from our
hotel, though but little more than a block away, and so
persistent that it did not lift during the whole of our
stay. Add to these conditions the slush in the streets and
the penetrating quality of the damp, cold air, and our
desire to push on at once to the farther south in search
of more genial skies will not seem unnatural. And we
might have done so, notwithstanding the attraction of the
Cathedral and of Leonardo's picture of the "Last Supper"
(which, however, we expected to see on our return to
Northern Italy in the spring), had it not been for our
anxiety to get a sight of the Iron Crown of Lombardy at
Monza, a few miles north of Milan. And see it we did,
in spite of the weather, as I shall tell you more fully
in a later letter. We ate our Thanksgiving dinner at
Milan, visited again and again the white marble Cathedral,
whose delicate stone lace work was touched into
marvellous and weird beauty by the snow clinging to its
pinnacles and projections and statues, saw Leonardo's
picture, and the other principal sights, and then took the
train for Venice.</p>

<p>Of the palaces that we visited, the one in which the poet
Browning lived, and in which his son now lives, is the
best preserved, and illustrates better than
any other the almost regal state in which the
wealthy Venetians lived in the day of their commercial
supremacy. One of these old palaces on the Grand Canal
is now used as a bank. Some are used as warehouses,
and others are put to still meaner uses. The Doge's
Palace is, of course, the largest and finest, but it is more
like a public building than a residence. Next to this
stands the chief architectural glory of Venice, the gorgeous
Cathedral of St. Mark, with its unequalled profusion
of costly materials, and its ominously uneven stone
floor, suggesting the painful possibility that it, too, may
some day share the fate of the great Campanile, which
till last summer lifted its head three hundred and seventy-five
feet in the air from the pavement of the square in
front. We found the ruins of this graceful structure, up
the winding incline of which Napoleon Bonaparte is said
to have ridden his horse to the belfry, lying in a heap
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
on the square surrounded by a temporary unpainted board
fence. Workmen within were making preparations for
the erection of the new bell tower which is to take the
place of the old one. On the first Sunday after our arrival
we heard the Rev. Dr. Robertson, at the Presbyterian
Church, make felicitous use of the fate of the old Campanile
in a sermon on the text, "Other foundation can no
man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ." Nowhere
are foundations of more importance than in Venice.
The whole city is built upon piles. The Rialto Bridge,
a great marble arch of a single span, rests upon twelve
thousand of these piles, which are driven deep into the
mud.</p>

<p>The interior of the Church of the Jesuits made more
impression upon us than any other Venetian church except
St. Marks. It looks at first view like it was lined throughout
with chintz, through which runs a green pattern; but
on closer inspection you find that it is all white marble&mdash;the
pulpit and its heavy curtains, the altar steps, the walls
from floor to ceiling, are all of white marble, and the
green pattern is nothing less than verd antique.</p>

<p>Some of our young people, who had already wearied
of the miles of picture galleries in Europe, manifested
but little interest in the rich collection of art at Venice,
but I think that all brought away an indelible impression
of Titian's splendid "Assumption of the Virgin." They
felt a much keener interest in the marvellous skill of the
Venetian glass-makers at Murano. But their special delight
was the gondolas. They soon had their favorites
among the gondoliers, and, with Marco and Pedro propelling
them, threaded the innumerable canals in every
direction, visited the outlying islands, drifted hither and
thither on the broad lagoons, and enjoyed the distant
views of this strangely beautiful city, sometimes looming

through the mist, at other times standing out sharp and
clear against the red sky of a flaming sunset.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Greatest of
the Venetians.</div>

<p>Nothing in all the strange history of Venice
interested us so much as the career of Fra
Paolo Sarpi, "the greatest of the Venetians," as Dr. Alexander
Robertson well calls him in his striking biography
of that illustrious thinker and man of action. An ecclesiastic
whom Gibbon calls "the incomparable historian of
the Council of Trent"; a mathematician of whom Galileo
said, "No man in Europe surpasses Master Paolo Sarpi
in his knowledge of the science of mathematics"; an
anatomist whom Acquapendente, the famous surgeon of
Padua, calls "the oracle of this century"; a metaphysician
who, as Lord Macaulay says, anticipated "Locke on the
Human Understanding"; and a statesman who saved
Venice from the domination of the papacy&mdash;it is no wonder
that Dr. Bedell, chaplain of the English Ambassador
to Venice, should have said that he was "holden for a
miracle in all manner of knowledge, divine and human."
"As a statesman, the great Republic of Venice committed
all its interests to his guidance, and he made its history,
while he lived, an unbroken series of triumphs; in an
age when the papacy lifted high its head, and rode roughshod
over the rights of kings and peoples, he forced Pope
Paul V., one of the haughtiest of Rome's Pontiffs, to his
knees, and so shattered in his hands the weapon of interdict
and excommunication that never again has it served
the interest of a wearer of the tiara. Constitutional government
everywhere owes something to Fra Paolo; and
modern Italian history is the outcome and embodiment
of the principles he laid down in his voluminous State
papers. He was stronger than the papacy, for, in spite
of the hatred, persecution and protest of Pope and Curia,
he lived and died within the pale of the church, enjoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the esteem and affection of its clergy, performing all his
priestly duties, and receiving, as the Senate wrote in its
circular announcing his death to the courts of Europe,
'<i>Li santissimi sagramenti con ogni maggior pieta</i>.' And

his death it began to succumb to papal domination, and
to totter to its fall."</p>

<p>We visited the Servite Monastery, where he lived, the
bridge where he was set upon and stabbed by the Pope's
hired assassins, and where his statue now stands, and the
grave in the island cemetery of Venice where his body
rests at last after all the strange adventures and removals
made necessary by the ghoulish malice of his foes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bologna,
the Fat.</div>

<p>The business activity of Bologna is in sharp
contrast with the stagnation and decay of
Venice. It is a brisk and handsome city, with well-paved
streets, flanked by arcades like those along the Rue de
Rivoli in Paris. Bologna has an unequalled number of
these colonnades. They are so continuous, indeed, and
afford such perfect protection from the sun in summer
and the rain in winter, that it is more nearly possible to
dispense with umbrellas here than in any other city in the
world. The greatest of these covered ways is the portico
which winds up the mountain just outside the city, by
an easy gradation, to the costly church of the Madonna
di S. Lucca, which, as its name indicates, possesses an
image of the Virgin said to have been the work of Saint
Luke. There are no fewer than six hundred and thirty-five
arches in this colonnade, and they command lovely
views on either side, as one ascends; but the view from
the church, at the top of the mountain, caps the climax,
combining, as it does, Alps, Appennines, Adriatic, plains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
and cities. It is from the arches of this long colonnade
up the mountain that one gets the best impression of
Bologna's towers. They are very numerous, and many
of them are out of the perpendicular. In fact, there are
more leaning towers here than in any other city in the
world. But, unlike "Pisa's leaning miracle," these are
not beautiful. They are imposing only in the grouping
of a distant view, being nothing but quadrangular masses
of ugly brown brick, with no ornaments, no windows,
and indeed no known uses, the object for which they were
erected being now an insoluble mystery.</p>

<p>Bologna has important manufactures of silk goods,
velvet, crape, chemicals, paper, musical instruments, soap
and sausages. We made full trial of the last two mentioned
commodities, and found them excellent. But Bologna,
while vital and modern, is not lacking in the matter
of antiquity and literary and historical interest. It boasts
the oldest university in the world, founded in 425 A. D.
In the thirteenth century it had ten thousand students,
and it still has over a thousand. In front of the University
stands a statue of Galvani, holding a tablet on which
he is exhibiting the famous frog legs. But it is said that
"his wife was the real discoverer of galvanism, having
laid some frogs, which she was preparing for soup, beside
a charged electrical machine; and it was she who observed
the convulsion in the frogs which she touched with
the scalpel, and communicated the discovery to her husband,
who repeated the experiment at the University."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Flower of
Fair Cities.</div>

<p>Florence! "City of fair flowers, and flower
of fair cities!" Second only to Rome itself
in variety and wealth of historical, artistic and literary
interest, home of Dante and Boccacio, Machiavelli and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
the Medici, Galileo and Amerigo Vespucci, Savonarola
and Fra Angelico, Cimabue, Giotto, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti,
Donatello, Michelangelo and Benvenuto Cellini&mdash;what
can one do in a letter like this but merely name them
and pass on, hoping for a time of larger leisure to say at
least a word concerning the most illustrious of them?</p>

<p>In the Uffizi Gallery, which is "a complete exemplification
of the progress and development of art," there
is an octagonal room, called the Tribune, which contains
perhaps the richest aggregation of masterpieces in the
world. Sculpture is represented by the Venus de Medici,
the Young Apollo, The Wrestlers, The Grinder, and The
Dancing Faun; and painting by no less remarkable pictures.
In addition to these, the things that stand out in
one's memory in connection with Florence are Cellini's
"Perseus," Ghiberti's "Doors," Michael Angelo's "David"
and his "Lorenzo de Medici," Brunelleschi's "Dome," and
last, but not least, Giotto's "Tower," "the model and
mirror of perfect architecture," of which John Ruskin
says: "The characteristics of Power and Beauty occur
more or less in different buildings&mdash;some in one and
some in another. But all together, all in their highest
possible relative degrees, they exist, as far as I know,
only in one building in the world&mdash;the Campanile of
Giotto at Florence." For the proper appreciation of
almost any other great production of art some education
in art is necessary, but any one can see the transcendant
beauty of Giotto's "Tower." Untutored as we are in
these matters, we never wearied of looking at it.</p>

<p>In the freshness of its undimmed splendor, there is
nothing in Florence to compare with the Medici Chapel.
It is still unfinished, but has cost up to the present time
three million five hundred thousand dollars. It is probably
the most magnificent mausoleum in the world. "The walls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
are covered with costly marbles, inlaid with precious
stones&mdash;a gorgeous mosaic of the richest material."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Reformer
before the
Reformation.</div>

<p>But, after all, the thing that lays deepest
hold of us in Florence is the story of Savonarola,
Harbinger of the Reformation and
Martyr for the Truth. That little cell in the Monastery
of San Marco, where he once lived, and where his manuscript
sermons, his annotated books and his wooden crucifix
are still shown; those fearful dungeons in the
Palazzo Vecchio, where the greatest man of his age endured
his forty days' imprisonment, and lay during the
intervals of torture, and spent his last hours on earth;
and the bustling Piazza Della Signoria, which witnessed
the triumphant tragedy of May 23, 1498&mdash;Florence has
nothing else so impressive as these. We visit them with
subdued hearts and reverent spirits. "On the 22nd of
May, 1498, it was announced to Savonarola and his
friends, Domenico and Maruffi, that they were to be
executed by five the next morning; our heroic preacher
was thoroughly resigned to his share of the doom, saying
to Domenico, 'Knowest thou not it is not permitted to a
man to choose the mode of his own death?' The three
friends partook of the sacrament of the Holy Supper,
administered by Savonarola. He said, 'We shall soon
be there, where we can sing with David, "Behold how
good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together
in unity!"' They were then taken to the tribunal, where
they were divested of all their priestly decorations, during
which the bishop took Savonarola by the hand, saying,
'Thus I exclude thee from the church militant and triumphant.'
'From the church militant thou mayest,' exclaimed
Savonarola, 'but from the church triumphant
thou canst not; that does not belong to thee.'...
The last that was beheld of him was his hand uplifted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
as if to bless the people; the last that was heard of him,
'My Saviour, though innocent, willingly died for my sins,
and should I not willingly give up this poor body out of
love to him?' The cinders of the bodies of the martyred
friars were carted away, and thrown into the river Arno."

<div class="sidenote">Pisa's Four
Monuments.</div>

<p>The four chief objects of interest at Pisa
are all in a group at the northern end of
the town, and a wonderfully effective group it is: the
cloistered cemetery, or Camp Santo, with its fifty-five
shiploads of earth from the Holy Land; the Baptistery,
with its remarkable echo; the Cathedral, with the pendent
lamp in the nave which suggested to Galileo the idea of
the pendulum; and that wonder of the world, the white
marble Tower, which leans thirteen feet out of the perpendicular.
We all tried in vain to stand with heels and
back to the inside of the north wall on the ground floor&mdash;it
cannot be done; one falls forward at once. From the
top there is a magnificent view of the city and the surrounding
plain, of the mountains on the east and the
sea on the west, of the city of Leghorn and the island
of Elba.</p>

<p>From the windows of our hotel at Pisa we saw for
the first time the red gold of ripe oranges shining amid
their dark green leaves in the gardens, and rejoiced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
think that at last we had reached a somewhat milder
climate, and were now leaving rigorous winter behind us.</p>

<p>The journey from Pisa to Rome is a long one, and the
schedule was such that we did not arrive till late at night.
From the car windows we had some impressive views
of the Mediterranean by moonlight, and of the solemn
campagna, and, thus prepared, we crossed the Tiber at
midnight, and passed through the breach in the walls
which has been made for the railway, feeling, perhaps
even more deeply than is usual, the thrill with which all
travellers except those who are utterly devoid of imagination
first enter the Eternal City.</p>

Unfavorable to
Letter-writing
Abroad.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> margin of leisure left to a traveller in Europe
for the writing of letters is, after all, a very narrow
one, as those of my readers who have been abroad will
readily remember. One generally moves from place to
place in such rapid succession that the feeling
of being settled, which is essential to
the most satisfactory writing, is almost unknown.
Then, when one does stop for a
few days in a historic city, each day is so full of interest,
and the golden opportunity to see its sights seems so fleeting,
that one hesitates to take any part of such time for
writing, to say nothing of the weariness and drowsiness
of an evening that follows a day of sightseeing.</p>

<p>Add to this the amount of time required of one who
acts as general director of the tour, and has to take account
of all manner of business details, and the number
of questions to be answered when there are three or four
young people in the party who have read just enough
general history to make their minds bristle with interrogations
at every interesting place, and who have to be read
to daily <i>en masse</i> on the spot in order to improve the
psychological moment of excited curiosity; add also the
physician's injunction to take abundance of exercise in

<div class="sidenote">An American
Baby in
Europe.</div>

<p>It may interest some of my younger readers
to know that the member of our party who
receives the most attention is a little blue-eyed
girl, just two years old to-day, who is the most
extraordinary traveller of her age that I ever saw or
ever heard of, accepting all the irregularities, inconveniences
and discomforts of this migratory mode of life with
the serene indifference of a veteran. We naturally supposed
that, being so young, she would give us more or
less trouble on so long a journey, and this proved to be
true on the cold and rough sea voyage, but, from the
day that we landed on this side of the ocean, she has been
a delight to our whole party, a maker of friends wherever
we have gone, and an immensely interesting object to the
populace of the cities through which we have passed. At
Leyden, in Holland, as we passed along the streets, we
were followed all over town by an admiring throng of
Dutch children, just out of school, to whom our baby's
bright red coat and cap were no less interesting than their
wooden shoes were to us; and so we found out how the
elephants and monkeys and musicians and other people
who make up the street parade of a circus may be supposed
to feel when they pass through a town followed
by the motley gang of school boys, ragamuffins, and general
miscellanies of humanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Something
New in
Venice.</div>

<p>At Wiesbaden, in Germany, we bought one
of those odd little German baby carts with
two wheels and two handles, like plow
handles, between which the person who pushes it walks,
the baby really riding backwards, instead of forwards, as
in our American baby carriages. You will see from this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
description that German baby carriages are like the German
language&mdash;all turned the wrong way, though it must
be said for this arrangement that the baby is not so likely
to be lonesome as when riding face forward, since she
always has some one to look at. Well, at Venice, which
is almost a dead town now, so far as business is concerned,
and which has perhaps as large a leisure class&mdash;that
is, street loafers&mdash;as any city of equal size on this
terraqueous planet, a lady of our party essayed to take
the baby out for an airing in her German cart. It would
appear that it was the first time since the foundation of
that pile-driven city in the sea that a pair of wheels was
ever seen on her streets. At any rate, from the moment
that the lady and the baby and the cart emerged from
the hotel door they were attended by an ever-increasing
throng of unwashed Venetians, whose interest could not
have been keener had Santos Dumont's air-ship or a Japanese
jinriksha suddenly appeared in their gondola-ridden
town, and who commented in shrill Italian on this wheeled
apparition. The lady is not easily beaten when she decides
to do anything, but, after standing that for half a block
or so, she made a hasty retreat to the hotel, and wheels
disappeared, probably forever, from the streets of Venice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gondolas and
Gondoliers.</div>

<p>Although Venice, with its population of
one hundred and sixty-three thousand, is
seven miles in circumference, and is divided by one hundred
and forty-six canals into one hundred and seventeen
islands, yet these are so joined together by means of four
hundred bridges that it is possible to walk all over the
city. But the bridges are built in steps, and cannot be
used by wheeled vehicles. There are no horses or carriages
of any kind. The funereal-looking gondola, always
painted black, is the only conveyance upon these streets
of water, and does duty for cab, omnibus, wagon, cart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
wheelbarrow and hearse. It is used for pleasure riding,
shopping, church-going, theatre-going, visiting, carrying
prisoners to jail, carrying the dead to the cemetery&mdash;in
short, for everything.</p>

<p>In propelling this black but graceful and easy-going
boat, the gondolier does not sit. He stands, on a sort
of deck platform towards the stern, and to balance his
weight there is affixed to the prow a heavy piece of shining
steel, which rears itself at the front almost like a
figure-head, only this is always of the same pattern, simply
a broad, upright blade of steel, notched deeply on the
front edge. The gondolier does not pull the oar, he pushes
it&mdash;there is only one oar&mdash;and he does not change it
from side to side, as in paddling a canoe, but makes all
the strokes on one side, a thing that looks very easy, but
is in fact extremely difficult. The dexterity of these men
with their long single oar is wonderful. They glide in
and out among scores of gondolas on the crowded canals
without collision or jerking, and they turn a corner within
an inch.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Baggage Smashing
in Europe.</div>

<p>These remarks upon the skill of the gondoliers,
and the ease and safety of the gondolas,
remind me, by contrast, of the destructive bungling
of a porter in Cologne, who undertook to cart a load of
trunks and handbags and shawl-straps down from our
hotel to the Rhine steamer, and who, in turning a corner
on a down grade, made the turn too short, and hurled
the whole lot of our belongings into the muddy street
with such violence that many of them were defaced, some
permanently damaged, and one valise broken to pieces
and utterly ruined.</p>

<p>That German baby carriage had an exciting adventure
also on the night of our arrival in Rome. As usual, it
was made the apex of the pyramid of trunks and grip-sacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
which constitute our sign manual, so to speak, on
the top of every omnibus that takes us from the station
to the hotel; but in this instance it was carelessly left
untied, so that as we went steeply down one of the seven
hills of Rome, the cart tumbled from its high perch to the
stone-paved street, snapping off one of the handles, and
suffering sundry other shattering experiences. A few
days after we had the pleasure of paying a fraudulent
cabinetmaker more for repairing it than it cost in the first
instance. The Italian workmen and shopkeepers uniformly
charge you more than their work and goods are
worth. I think I have had more counterfeit money passed
on me in the short time I have been in Italy than I have
had in all the rest of my life before, and the very first
swindle of this kind to which I was subjected was in a
church, when the sacristan gave me a counterfeit two-franc
piece in change as I paid the admission fees to see
certain paintings and sculptures behind the high altar.</p>

<p>However, I am wandering from my subject; I may
conclude my eulogy on the baby above mentioned by saying
that, young as she is, she sits through the seventy or
eighty minutes of the customary tedious European dinner
almost as circumspectly as a graven image might, but
reminding us of one of Raphael's cherubs in her blue-eyed
combination of sweetness, archness and dignity.</p>

<p>Next time we will resume our account of matters of
more general interest.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I had</span> heard of relics before. Years ago I had read
Mark Twain's account of the large piece of the true
cross which he had seen in a church in the Azores; and
of another piece which he had seen in the Cathedral of
Notre Dame in Paris, besides some nails of the true cross
and a part of the crown of thorns; and of the marble
chest in the Cathedral of San Lorenzo at Genoa, which
he was told contained the ashes of St. John, and was
wound about with the chain that had confined St. John
when he was in prison; and of the interesting collection
shown him in the Cathedral of Milan, including two of
St. Paul's fingers and one of St. Peter's, a bone of Judas
Iscariot (black, not white), and also bones of all the other
disciples (presumably of the normal color), a handkerchief
in which the Saviour had left the impression of his
face, part of the crown of thorns, a fragment of the purple
robe worn by Christ, a picture of the Virgin and Child
painted by St. Luke, and a nail from the cross&mdash;adding
in another place that he thought he had seen in all not
less than a keg of these nails.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palladium

<p>I had read repeatedly the story of the bringing
of St. Mark's bones from Alexandria,
in Egypt, to their present resting-place in St. Mark's
Cathedral at Venice&mdash;a story which is related as follows
in that same lively volume:</p>

<p>"St. Mark died at Alexandria, in Egypt. He was
martyred, I think. However, that has nothing to do with
my legend. About the founding of the city of Venice&mdash;say
four hundred and fifty years after Christ&mdash;(for
Venice is much younger than any other Italian city), a
priest dreamed that an angel told him that until the remains
of St. Mark were brought to Venice, the city could
never rise to high distinction among the nations; that
the body must be captured, brought to the city, and a
magnificent church built over it; and that if ever the
Venetians allowed the Saint to be removed from his new
resting-place, in that day Venice would perish from off
the face of the earth. The priest proclaimed his dream,
and forthwith Venice set about procuring the corpse of
St. Mark. One expedition after another tried and failed,
but the project was never abandoned during four hundred
years. At last it was secured by stratagem, in the year
eight hundred and something. The commander of the
Venetian expedition disguised himself, stole the bones,
separated them, and packed them in vessels filled with
lard. The religion of Mahomet causes its devotees to
abhor anything in the nature of pork, and so when the
Christian was stopped at the gate of the city, they only
glanced once into the precious baskets, then turned up
their noses at the unholy lard, and let him go. The bones
were buried in the vaults of the grand cathedral, which
had been waiting long years to receive them, and thus the
safety and the greatness of Venice were secured. And
to this day there be those in Venice who believe that if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
those holy ashes were stolen away, the ancient city would
vanish like a dream, and its foundation be buried forever
in the unremembering sea."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Gift of

<p>More recently I had read of what has been
well called the burlesque enacted at Arundel
Castle no longer ago than in July, 1902, in
which the Duke of Norfolk, Cardinal Vaughan, and many
lesser ornaments and dignitaries of the Romish Church,
took part.</p>

<p>"Pope Leo XIII., in order to show his 'good-will to
England,' sent from Rome the remains of St. Edmund
to garnish the new Roman Catholic cathedral at Westminster.
It was an appropriate gift, for such buildings
are usually garnished with 'dead men's bones and all uncleanness.'
But as the cathedral is not yet finished, as a
further token of good-will, the relics were committed to
the care of no less a personage than the Earl Marshal of
England. They arrived at Arundel on the evening of
July 25th, and were placed for the night in Fitzalen
Chapel. The next morning the whole castle was astir
betimes, for the great event of the day, the transference
of the bones to the castle chapel, was to take place. This
was accomplished in a solemn and befitting manner. A
procession was formed, and, to the measured tread of
the Earl Marshal of England, Cardinal Vaughan, several
archbishops and bishops, and a mixed company of priests
and acolytes and a numerous train of household servants
and dependents, carrying banners, crosses, crucifixes,
censers, lamps, candles, torches, and other ecclesiastical
stage paraphernalia, the remains of St. Edmund were
borne to their resting-place. All went off well, and at
last the curtain fell on the finished play, to the satisfaction
of every one. Unfortunately, however, the Pope and all
concerned had to reckon with English common-sense and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
with English love of truth, and it was not very long before
it was proved to the world that the bones, like most relics
of the kind, were counterfeit&mdash;whoever else's bones they
were, they were not those of St. Edmund."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a>

<div class="sidenote">The Blood of

<p>I had read with cordial approval Mark
Twain's animadversions upon the fraud
which is regularly practiced on the people of Naples by
the priests in the Cathedral:</p>

<p>"In this city of Naples they believe in and support
one of the wretchedest of all religious impostures one can
find in Italy&mdash;the miraculous liquefaction of the blood
of St. Januarius. Twice a year the priests assemble all
the people at the Cathedral, and get out this phial of
clotted blood, and let them see it slowly dissolve and
become liquid; and every day for eight days this dismal
farce is repeated, while the priests go among the crowd
and collect money for the exhibition. The first day the
blood liquefies in forty-seven minutes&mdash;the church is full
then, and time must be allowed the collectors to get
around; after a while it liquefies a little quicker and a
little quicker every day, as the houses grow smaller, till
on the eighth day, with only a few dozen present to see
the miracle, it liquefies in four minutes.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"And here, also, they used to have a grand procession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
of priests, citizens, soldiers, sailors, and the high dignitaries
of the city government, once a year, to shave the
head of a made-up Madonna&mdash;a stuffed and painted
image, like the milliner's dummy&mdash;whose hair miraculously
grew and restored itself every twelve months.
They still kept up this shaving procession as late as four
or five years ago. It was a source of great profit to the
church that possessed the remarkable effigy, and the
public barbering of her was always carried out with the
greatest <i>éclat</i> and display&mdash;the more the better, because
the more excitement there was about it the larger the
crowds it drew and the heavier the revenues it produced&mdash;but
at last the day came when the Pope and his servants
were unpopular in Naples, and the city government
stopped the Madonna's annual show.</p>

<p>"There we have two specimens of these Neapolitans&mdash;two
of the silliest possible frauds, which half the population
religiously and faithfully believed, and the other half
either believed or else said nothing about, and thus lent
themselves to the support of the imposture."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The House of
the Virgin
at Loretto.</div>

<p>I had read the story of the <i>Casa Santa</i>, or
Holy House, the little stone building, thirteen
and one-half feet high and twenty-eight
feet long, in which the Virgin Mary had lived at Nazareth.
In 336 the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine the
Great, made a pilgrimage to Nazareth and built a church
over the Holy House. This church fell into decay when
the Saracens again got the upper hand in Palestine, and
when the Christians lost Ptolemais the Holy House was
carried by angels through the air from Nazareth to the
coast of Dalmatia. This miraculous transportation took
place in 1291. A few years later it was again removed
by angels during the night, and set down in the Province
of Ancona, near the eastern coast of Italy, on the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of a widow named <i>Laureta</i>. Hence the name, <i>Loretto</i>,
given to the town which sprang up around it for the
accommodation of the thousands of pilgrims who flocked
thither, and which is now a place of some six thousand
inhabitants, whose principal business is begging and the
sale of rosaries, medals and images. In a niche inside
the Casa Santa is a small black image of the Virgin and
Child, of cedar, attributed, of course, to St. Luke. We
did not visit Loretto, but at Bologna we had the satisfaction
of seeing a <i>fac-simile</i> of the Casa Santa, with its little
window and fireplace, and the replica of St. Luke's handi-work
in the niche above. A large number of women, some
of them handsomely dressed, were saying their prayers
and counting their beads before the altar that had been
erected in front of these images and the Holy House, and
a few were kneeling in the narrow space behind the altar,
close to the fireplace of the house. As we passed, one
of these women, in plainer garb, interrupted her devotions
long enough to hold out her hand to us, begging for
pennies, but without rising from her knees. There was
nothing unusual about this, except that this beggar made
her appeal to us while actually on her knees to the image
of the Virgin, for nothing is more common in Italy than
for visitors to a Roman Catholic church to pass through
such "an avenue of palms" when leaving it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Wonder-working
Bones
of St. Anne
in Canada.</div>

<p>I had even seen a few relics, not mere reproductions
like that of the Casa Santa at Bologna,
but the relics themselves. For instance,
three summers ago, when in Quebec,
I had made a special trip to the Church of St. Anne
Beaupre, some twenty miles below the city, for the purpose
of seeing the wonder-working relics of St. Anne,
the alleged mother of the Virgin Mary&mdash;a bit of her
finger bone and a bit of her wrist bone&mdash;which are devoutly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
kissed and adored by thousands of pilgrims to this
magnificent church from all the French and Irish portions
of Canada, and which are said to have wrought miraculous
cures of all manner of maladies, cures which are attested
by two immense stacks of canes, crutches, wooden legs,
and the like, which rise from the floor almost to the roof
on either side of the entrance. In the store in another
part of the church I had got a clue to it all by seeing the
poor pilgrims buying all sorts of cheap, tawdry, worthless
little images and pictures, and especially little vials of
oil of remarkable curative virtue because it had stood for
a while before the image of St. Anne, and for which they
paid probably five times as much as the oil had cost the
priests who were selling it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Iron Crown
of Lombardy.</div>

<p>These, then, are potent bones and images
and oils, but by far the most interesting relic
I had seen before reaching Rome itself was the Iron
Crown of Lombardy, at Monza, a little town in Northern
Italy. This is the place where the good King Humbert
was assassinated on the 29th of July, 1900, and it is not
without interest for other reasons. For instance, it has
a cathedral built of black and white marble in horizontal
stripes, and containing, besides the tomb of Queen Theodolinda
and other interesting objects in the nave and its
chapels, a great number of costly articles of gold and
silver, set with precious stones, in the treasury, as well
as various relics, such as some of the baskets carried by
the apostles, a piece of the Virgin Mary's veil, and one
of John the Baptist's teeth. But we should never have
made a special trip to Monza in such weather as we were
having at the time of our visit, last November, had it not
been for our intense desire to see its chief treasure, the
Iron Crown, the most sacred and most celebrated diadem
in the world, a relic possessing real historical interest,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
not because of any probability whatever in the story of
its origin, but because of the extraordinary uses and associations
of it within the last thousand years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Winter Trip
to Monza.</div>

<p>So, regardless of the wet, cold, foggy
weather that we found in Milan, and the
rivers of mud and slush that were then doing duty for
streets, and the splotches of snow that lay here and there
in the forlorn-looking olive orchards, we took the electric
tram, which was comfortably heated, and ran out to
Monza, a distance of some ten miles. When we stepped
into the chilly cathedral and looked about us, we could
not at first see anybody to show us around, though there
were a good many poor people saying their prayers there.
Evidently the custodians were not expecting tourists at
such a season and in such weather. But presently, in an
apartment to the left, we found a number of the priests
warming their hands over a dish of twig coals covered
with a light layer of white ashes, which they kindly stirred
a little to make them give forth more heat as they saw
us stretch our cold hands also towards the grateful
warmth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Treasury of
the Cathedral.</div>

<p>When we asked if we could see the Iron
Crown, they said we could; but instead of
going at once to the chapel in which it is kept, they got
a great bag of keys, large keys, thirty-seven in number,
as the observant statistician of our party ascertained, and
led us into the treasury and unlocked a great number of
doors (one of which had seven locks), and showed us
the costly objects and precious relics above mentioned.
We were only mildly interested in these&mdash;even in the
apostolic baskets, the Virgin's veil, and John the Baptist's
tooth&mdash;partly because we were so cold and partly because
of our greater interest in the more famous relic which we
had come especially to see.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chapel of
the Great Relic.</div>

<p>At last one of the priests, attended by an
acolyte, took up a censer, placed a little
incense on the coals with a teaspoon, and, swinging it in
his hand by the chain, led us back into the cathedral,
turned to a chapel on the left, unlocked an iron gate in a
tall railing which separated this chapel from the body of
the building, closed the gate again when our party had
come inside, and, while a dozen or so of the people who
had been at their devotions crowded up to the railing and
peered curiously through, he and his attendant began to
kneel repeatedly before the altar and to swing the smoking
censer on every side. Above the altar was a strong,
square steel box, over which, in plain view, was suspended
a <i>fac-simile</i> of the Iron Crown, made of cheaper materials,
while the real crown was still concealed within the
steel safe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Great Relic
itself.</div>

<p>Handing the censer to his attendant, that it
might be kept swinging without intermission,
the priest produced another series of keys and proceeded
to unlock a succession of small doors in the side
of the metal safe, which proved to be a "nest" of caskets,
one within another, the last of which was a glass case.
Drawing this out, he brought into full view the venerated
crown of the Lombard kings, and told us to step up on
the stool by the altar so as to see it better. It is made
of six plates of gold, joined end to end, richly chased,
and set with splendid jewels. But one would see at a
glance that neither the material, nor the workmanship,
nor the gems, could account for the unique reverence
with which it has been regarded for centuries, and an
indication of which we had just seen in the service conducted
by the priest. Among the regalia in the Tower
of London, and at several other places in Europe, we had
seen crowns which far surpassed this one in costliness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and beauty, but none of which, nor all of which combined,
had ever excited a thousandth part of the interest attaching
to this old crown in Monza.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Why the Crown
is so Sacred.</div>

<p>The explanation is this: within that ring
of jointed plates of gold runs a thin band of
iron, which priestly tradition says was made of one of the
spikes that fastened the feet of our Lord Jesus Christ
to the cross. It was this band of iron that we tiptoed
to see, hardly noticing the bejewelled rim of gold around
it. It was on account of this band of iron that the priest
and his attendant swung their censer and performed their
ceremony as we entered. It was this band of iron that
gave to the crown its sacred place above the altar. It
was for the safe keeping of this band of iron that the
steel case, with its numerous locks, was made. It was
from this band of iron that the diadem received its name,
the Iron Crown of Lombardy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How it was
Used by Charlemagne
and
Napoleon.</div>

<p>And what were the historical uses of it, referred
to above, which made it so much
more interesting to us than the many other
so-called nails of the true cross elsewhere?
Well, this among others: on the last Christmas day of
the eighth century, while Charlemagne was kneeling with
uncovered head before the high altar of St. Peter's in
Rome, the Pope approached him from behind, and,
placing the Iron Crown of Lombardy on his head, hailed
him as Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.</p>

<p>A thousand years later on the 26th of May, 1805,
Napoleon Bonaparte, "watched by an apparently invincible
army which adored him and a world which feared
him," standing in the vast marble cathedral at Milan,
with fifteen thousand of his soldiers around him, lifted
this same Iron Crown of Lombardy into their view, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
placed it upon his brow, saying, "God has given it to me,
let him touch it who dares!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">High Reflections
and Hard
Cash.</div>

<p>That men who, like Charlemagne and Napoleon,
had reached the highest pinnacle of
human power, should seek to enhance their
influence by crowning their heads with one of the nails
which, as their followers believed, had pierced the Galilean's
foot, is a richly suggestive fact. But we must keep
our tempted thoughts to another and less edifying line at
present.</p>

<p>When we had examined all the parts of the famous
crown to our satisfaction, we stepped to the desk in the
ante-room and paid our five francs (one dollar), the regular
price for the exhibition of the Iron Crown, then left
the cathedral, bought one or two post-card pictures of
the crown, and took the tram through the dreary weather
back to Milan, well pleased with the results of our first
pilgrimage to the shrine of a real Roman Catholic relic
in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rome Caps
the Climax.</div>

<p>But on our arrival at Rome, a month later,
we found that, interesting as were the relics
which we had seen or read of elsewhere, they were nothing
to those in the Eternal City itself. In this, as in
everything else except such little matters as cleanliness
and morality and truthfulness and honesty, Rome outvies
all her rivals. It is only fair to add, however, that, since
the overthrow of the papal sovereignty and the establishment
of a capable government, Rome has improved immensely
in the matter of cleanliness, and even her
immorality is not so flaunting as it was. This is attested
by the Hon. Guiseppe Zanardelli, the present Premier of
Italy, who says:</p>

<p>"The church appears better than it once was. I no
longer see in Rome what I used often to see in my young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
days, ladies driving about its streets with their coachmen
and footmen in the liveries of their respective cardinals.
Has this improvement come about because the church is
really growing better? Nothing of the kind. It is because
the strong arm of the law checks the villainy of
the priests." That is the testimony of the Prime Minister
of Italy.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<div class="sidenote">Do American
Roman
Catholics
Believe in
the Relics?</div>

<p>A few weeks after my return from Italy,
while driving one afternoon with a friend
of mine, a lawyer of high intelligence and
wide information, our conversation turned
to the subject of the recent death of Pope
Leo XIII., and from that drifted to the alleged liquefaction
of the blood of St. Januarius, and from that to relics
in general. I mentioned some of the facts above stated
concerning the numerous pieces of the true cross and the
miracle-working bones and oils to be seen in Roman
Catholic churches in Europe. "But," he said, "surely
the Roman Catholics in America do not believe in such
mediæval superstitions." I happened to have in hand a
couple of copies of a daily newspaper, published in one
of our Southern towns, dated August 9, 1903, and August
17, 1903, respectively, containing extracts from the letters
of a Roman Catholic bishop, the highest dignitary of
his church in that State; and, for answer to my friend's
remark, I cited the following passage from the bishop's
letter of July 10th, written from Munich, concerning the
abbey church of Scheyern:</p>

<p>"The chapel of the Holy Cross is specially sacred, as
within is preserved a very large piece of the true cross
upon which Christ was crucified, brought to Scheyern
in 1156 by Count Conrad, the Crusader, who afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
entered the monastery as lay-brother, and lies buried near
the altar upon which the sacred relic is preserved."</p>

<p>Also the following passage from his letter of July
12th, written from Eichstadt:</p>

<p>"I remained the guest of Prince Ahrenberg for the
night, and early in the morning, accompanied by some
Benedictine students, I made a pilgrimage to the shrine
of St. Walburg. Above the altar is the large silver receptacle
into which flows the miraculous oil from her sacred
relics, which is known the world over."</p>

<div class="sidenote">What America
Needs is
Some Relics.</div>

<p>Writing from Vienna, July 20, 1903, concerning
the imperial palaces, he says, "They
are awfully big and grand, and cost a lot
of good people's money," but adds that "the pride and
glory of Vienna" is the Cathedral, and then exclaims:
"How often have I wished we could have some such
church in &mdash;&mdash;, so that our good people who cannot
visit the achievements of Catholic life in Europe could
form some idea of the greatness of the religion of their
fathers!"</p>

<p>One hesitates to differ from so good an authority on
such matters as this bishop, but really would he not
agree, on reflection, that what this benighted and decaying
country of ours needs to bring it up to a level with Italy
and Austria and Spain is not a big church, but some
relics? Would not some miraculous oil, or some wonder-working
bones, or a piece of the true cross, or one of the
nails, if placed on exhibition here attract far more attention
than a big church, and enable "our good people
who cannot visit the achievements of Catholic life in
Europe" to form a much better "idea of the greatness
of the religion of their fathers"? Does it not seem
strange that so many hundreds of these relics should be
kept in those enlightened and happy countries like Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
where "the achievements of Catholic life" are so well
known, and where Mother Church has for centuries had
full sway, and that none of them should be brought to
these benighted Protestant regions, where they could
effect such a salutary change in the faith of the people?
But, seriously, as I added to my friend in the conversation
referred to, I have a better opinion of the intelligence
of our good Roman Catholic people in America than to
believe that they put the slightest credence in these childish
superstitions. Whatever the bishop above quoted may
believe, I am confident that the intelligent Roman Catholic
people of our country have no more faith in many of
these alleged relics than we have.</p>

In July of this year, 1903, while the Roman Catholic world
was greatly exercised over the grave illness of the late Pope,
Leo XIII., the Associated Press dispatches from Naples reported
that the blood of St. Januarius had miraculously liquefied at that
unusual time in token that the prayers offered for the Pope's
recovery had been answered. The Archbishop of Naples has up
to the present time vouchsafed no explanation of the fact that
the Pope died a few days later, notwithstanding this miraculous
assurance that he would recover.</p></div></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Roman Catholic Relics at Rome.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">We</span> reached Rome at a good time for seeing relics,
as the special services of the Christmas season
were just beginning. One of the most splendid
of these ceremonies is the procession in honor of the
<i>Santa Culla</i>; that is, the cradle in which the priestly
tradition says the infant Jesus was carried into Egypt.
This is the great relic and chief distinction of the Church
of Santa Maria Maggiore, though it contains a number
of others, such as the bodies of St. Matthew and St.
Jerome, and two little bags of the brains of Thomas á
Becket, and "one of the pictures attributed to St. Luke
(and announced to be such in a papal bull attached to
the walls!), much revered for the belief that it stayed the
plague which decimated the city during the reign of
Pelagius II., and that (after its intercession had been
sought by a procession by order of Innocent VIII.) it
brought about the overthrow of the Moorish dominion in
Spain."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Miraculous
Snow in
Summertime.</div>

<p>Moreover, this church of Santa Maria Maggiore
is by no means lacking in legendary
and architectural interest. It was founded
A. D. 352, by Pope Liberius and John, a Roman patrician,
to commemorate an alleged miraculous fall of snow, which
covered this spot of ground and no other, on the 5th of
August, and an alleged appearance of the Virgin Mary,
in a vision, at the same time, showing them that she
had thus appropriated the site of a new temple, all of
which is duly represented in a fine painting on the wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
of the church, and in two of Murillo's most beautiful
pictures in the Academy at Madrid, and commemorated
every year on the 5th of August by a solemn high mass,
and by showers of white rose leaves thrown down constantly
through two holes in the ceiling, "like a leafy mist
between the priests and the worshippers."</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Splendid
Church.</div>

<p>The worshippers of the Virgin have not
been lacking in their efforts to erect a suitably
sumptuous building on the site of this "miracle."
The magnificent nave, with its avenue of forty-two
columns of Greek marble, surmounted by a frieze of
mosaic pictures; the glorious pavement of <i>opus Alexandrinum</i>,
whose "crimson and violet hues temper the white
and gold of the walls"; the grand <i>baldacchino</i>, with its
four porphyry columns wreathed with gilt leaves; and
the splendid tomb chamber of Pius IX. (predecessor of
the late Pope Leo XIII.), with its riot of rich marbles
and alabaster, in front of the high altar&mdash;to say nothing
of the almost incredibly costly chapels opening into the
nave&mdash;combine to give S. Maria Maggiore a proud place
among the very finest of the fine basilicas of Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Dazzling
Scene.</div>

<p>But not all the splendors of the building,
nor all the fascination of its "miracles" and
legends, nor all the spell of its other relics, can equal the
interest attaching to the "<span class="smcap">Santa Culla</span>," the holy cradle.
On the afternoon of Christmas Day, we walked through
the wet streets to the front of the church, pushed back
the heavy, dirty screen of padded canvas, such as hangs
at the door of every great church in Italy, however fine,
and, stepping within, found ourselves in the midst of a
scene of the most dazzling splendor. The building was
brilliantly illuminated with hundreds of electric lights and
huge candles, which were sharply reflected by the glistening
marbles on every hand; the air was heavy with clouds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
of incense, through the blue smoke of which the lofty
ceiling looked higher than ever, and the organ and choir
were pouring forth the richest music, while a dense crowd
of people, many thousands, all standing, watched with
eager interest a small, crate-like object, made of slats of
dark wood, which rested on the high altar, enclosed in a
glass case, with a gold baby on top and gold ornaments
round about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Holy
Cradle.</div>

<p>We pushed our way through the crowd, so
as to get a satisfactory view of it while the
service was in progress&mdash;the genuflections, the robing
and disrobing of the archbishop, the chanting, and the
rest&mdash;after which six men, dressed in pure white from
head to foot (white gloves included), except for a red
circle and cross on the breast, knelt before the cradle,
then lifted it from the altar, with its gold and glass setting,
and placing it on a kind of litter on their shoulders,
under a gilt and white canopy borne by other attendants,
marched with it thus, in procession around the church,
along with a large crucifix under another canopy, and
followed by a long line of cardinals, bishops, priests and
acolytes, carrying it back finally to its place in the sacristy,
where it will remain till next Christmas Day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Christ
of Rome
a Babe or
a Corpse.</div>

<p>We squeezed our way through the great
crowd at the door, and walked back to our
hotel, wondering to what extent the usual
Roman Catholic conception of Christ had
deprived that organization of real spiritual energy; for,
almost invariably, Roman Catholic art represents him
either as a dead Christ on the cross, or a babe in his
mother's arms, and hardly ever as the risen and glorified
Lord, the Conqueror of death, the Leader of his people,
to whom all power is given in heaven and on earth&mdash;the
more usual Protestant conception. And we asked ourselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
whether this difference did not help to explain the
greater hopefulness, vigor and growth of Protestant
Christianity in these strenuous latter days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Little Doll
that Owns
a Large
Carriage.</div>

<p>But we were soon to learn that the Roman
Catholics did not think of the infant Christ
as lacking in power of a certain sort; on
the contrary they ascribe miraculous agency
even to an image of the divine babe. On the afternoon
of December 29th, as two of our party were returning to
our hotel, they passed at the foot of the Capitoline Hill
a carriage, out of the window of which hung a ribbon
or sash of cloth of gold, and they were not a little astonished
to observe that, as this carriage rolled along, people
knelt reverently before it on the street. Inside they saw
two bareheaded men holding a child on a pillow with a
wealth of lace about it. They thought perhaps it was
the royal carriage with the baby princess, but they could
not imagine why <i>men</i> should be nursing the baby, as that
is usually the employment of women, nor why the people
should kneel so reverently before the young princess, a
thing which they never did even for the king himself.
The fact is that, as they learned on the following afternoon
when visiting the Church of Ara Coeli, on the
Capitoline Hill, the carriage in question belonged to a
far more important personage in Rome than any princess,
though that personage was not even a living baby, but
only a doll. It was the coach of the famous Bambino&mdash;<i>Il
Santissimo Bambino</i>&mdash;which with its dress of gold and
silver tissue and its magnificent diamonds, emeralds and
rubies, is the chief attraction of this church.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE BAMBINO.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Wealth and
Power of the
Miraculous
Bambino.</div>

<p>Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his book on
<i>The Roman Catholic Church in Italy</i>, says:
"The Bambino is a doll about three feet
high, and it stands on a cushion in a glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
case. It is clad in rich robes with a crown on its head,
a regal order across its breast, and embroidered slippers
on its feet. From head to foot it is one mass of dazzling
jewelry, gold chains, strings of pearls, and diamond bracelets
and rings, which not only cover the neck, arms and
fingers, but are suspended, intermixed with crosses, stars,
hearts, monograms, and every kind of precious stone, to
all parts of its body. The only part unweighted with
gems is its round, priest-like, wax face. But all this display
of wealth, great in itself, is really only suggestive
of that untold quantity which it has brought, and is still
daily bringing, into the coffers of the church. People
are continually kneeling before this dumb idol, offering
petitions and leaving gifts, whilst letters containing requests,
accompanied with post-office orders and checks
to pay for the granting of the same, arrive by post for
it from various parts of the globe."</p>

<p>Hare's <i>Walks in Rome</i> gives the following account of
the Bambino and one of its most remarkable experiences:</p>

<p>"It has servants of its own, and a carriage in which
it drives out with its attendants, and goes to visit the sick;
for, though an infant, it is the oldest medical practitioner
in Rome. Devout peasants always kneel as the blessed
infant passes. Formerly it was taken to sick persons and
left on their beds for some hours, in the hope that it would
work a miracle. Now it is never left alone. In explanation
of this, it is said that an audacious woman formed
the design of appropriating to herself the holy image
and its benefits. She had another doll prepared of the
same size and appearance as the Santissimo, and having
feigned sickness and obtained permission to have it left
with her, she dressed the false image in its clothes, and
sent it back to Ara Coeli. The fraud was not discovered
till night, when the Franciscan monks were awakened by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
the most furious ringing of bells and by thundering
knocks at the west door of the church, and hastening
thither, could see nothing but a wee naked pink foot peeping
in from under the door; but when they opened the
door, without stood the little naked figure of the true
Bambino of Ara Coeli, shivering in the wind and rain&mdash;so
the false baby was sent back in disgrace, and the real
baby restored to its home, never to be trusted away alone
any more."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Communion
Table Used
by Christ.</div>

<p>But if I dwell on all these interesting relics
and images as I have done on the Holy
Cradle and the miraculous Bambino, I shall
never finish even the brief list of them which I had in
mind when I began. I must hasten on, contenting myself
with a bare mention of a few of the more notable relics
at the other churches.</p>

<p>On the 8th of January we paid our first visit to the
great Church of St. John Lateran,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> and here also the
relics interested us more than anything else. Under the
canopy in the centre the skulls of St. Peter and St. Paul
are preserved. Beneath the altar we saw the wooden
table on which the Apostle Peter is said to have "celebrated
mass" in the house of Pudens. The interest of
this relic, however, is completely eclipsed by that of another
relic over an altar at a little distance in the same
church, viz: the cedar table used by our Lord and his
disciples in the Last Supper. This table is concealed
behind a bronze relief representing that solemn scene in
the Upper Room at Jerusalem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Relics
at St. John
Lateran.</div>

<p>"The Basilica claims to possess many valuable
relics. Amongst these are some portions
of the manger in which Christ was
cradled, the shirt and seamless coat made for him by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Virgin; some of the barley loaves and small fishes miraculously
multiplied to feed the five thousand; the linen cloth
with which he dried the feet of his apostles; also Aaron's
rod, the rod with which Moses smote the Red Sea," etc.,
etc. (<i>Cook's Southern Italy</i>, p. 114.) We did not see
these, but in the cloister behind this church we were
shown a marble slab on pillars which was once an altar,
"at which the officiating priest doubted of the Real Presence,
when the wafer fell from his hand through the
stone, leaving a round hole, which still remains." Here,
too, we were shown a larger slab resting on pillars, more
than six feet from the ground, which marks the height
of our Saviour; also a porphyry slab, upon which the
soldiers cast lots for his seamless robe; and some columns
from Pilate's house in Jerusalem, which were rent by the
earthquake of the crucifixion.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE SCALA SANTA, ROME.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Holy Stairs
from Pilate's
Palace.</div>

<p>But the great relic of Pilate's House, and
one of the most interesting of all the relics
in Rome, is across the street from St. John
Lateran, viz., the world-renowned <i>Scala Santa</i>, or Holy
Stairway, a flight of twenty-eight marble steps, once ascended
by our Saviour in the palace of Pilate, and brought
from Jerusalem to Rome in 326 by the Empress Helena,
mother of Constantine the Great. They are covered with
a wooden casing, but holes have been left through which
the marble steps can be seen. Two of them are stained
with the Saviour's blood. These spots are covered with
glass. The light was rather dim, and as we entered a
gentleman struck a match and held it over one of these
glass-covered stains to show it to his little girl, so that,
passing just at that moment, we also had a good view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Man who
Crawled Up
and Walked
Down.</div>

<p>No foot is allowed to touch the <i>Scala Santa</i>;
it must be ascended on the knees. A number
of people were going up in this way
when we entered, pausing on each step to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
repeat a prayer, for which indulgences are granted by
the Pope. There are stairways on each side, by which
those who have thus crawled up may walk down. The
only man I know of that ever walked down the Holy
Stairs themselves, and the most illustrious man that ever
crawled up them on his knees, was Martin Luther. When
he had mounted slowly half way up, step by step on his
knees, he seemed to hear a voice saying, "The just shall
live by faith." Martin Luther rose from his knees, walked
down the staircase, and left the place a free man so far
as this superstition was concerned, and shortly afterwards
became the most formidable foe that ever assailed the
falsehood and corruption of the Romish Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Miraculous
Portrait and
the Shoes
of Christ.</div>

<p>At the top of the Scala Santa we saw
through a grating the beautiful silver tabernacle
containing the great relic which has
given to this chapel the name of <i>Sancta
Sanctorum</i>, viz.: the portrait of Christ, held by the
Romish Church to be authentic, having been drawn in
outline by St. Luke and finished by an angel, whence its
name "Acheiropoëton," <i>i. e.</i>, the picture made without
hands. The relic chamber here contains fragments of
the true cross, the sandals of Christ, and "the iron bar
of Hades which he brought away with him from that
doleful region,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> but we did not see these.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Inscription
on the
Cross, and
the Finger
of Thomas.</div>

<p>A short walk beyond the Scala Santa and
the Lateran brings us to the Church of
S. Croce in Gerusalemme, which is specially
rich in relics. Here our party was
shown a piece of the true cross of Christ
and the original plank bearing the inscription, "<i>Jesus,
Nazarene King</i>," in Hebrew, Greek and Latin, which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
placed over his head; also one of the nails used in his
crucifixion, and two of the thorns of his crown; besides
a large piece of the cross of the penitent thief who was
executed with him; and, most interesting of all in some
respects, the finger used by Thomas to resolve his doubts
as to the resurrection of Christ (John xx. 24-28).</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Bottle of
The Blood of
Christ.</div>

<p>In Percy's <i>Romanism</i> it is said that "the
list of relics on the right of the apsis of
S. Croce includes the finger of S. Thomas,
apostle, with which he touched the most holy side of our
Lord Jesus Christ; one of the pieces of money with which
the Jews paid the treachery of Judas; great part of the
veil and of the hair of the most blessed Virgin; a mass
of cinders and charcoal united in the form of a loaf, with
the fat of S. Lawrence, martyr; one bottle of the most
precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ; another of the
milk of the most blessed Virgin; a little piece of the stone
where Christ was born; a little piece of the stone where
our Lord sat when he pardoned Mary Magdalene; of
the stone where our Lord wrote the law given to Moses
on Mount Sinai; of the stone where reposed SS. Peter
and Paul; of the cotton which collected the blood of
Christ; of the manna which fed the Israelites; of the rod
of Aaron which flourished in the desert; of the relics of
the eleven prophets!"<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>But our party saw none of these except the finger of
Thomas. It is to be hoped that the others have been
withdrawn from exhibition, for surely superstition and
vulgarity can no further go. I fear, however, that those
who are willing to pay enough can still see "one bottle
of the most precious blood of our Lord Jesus Christ," and
"another of the milk of the most blessed Virgin"! There
is also "<i>una ampulla lactis Beatae Mariae Virginis</i>" among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
the many relics to be seen in the Church of SS. Cosmo
and Damiano, near the Forum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No Women
Admitted.</div>

<p>It is a curious illustration of Romish wrong-headedness
that women are never allowed to
enter the Chapel of St. Helena, in the Church of S. Croce,
except on the festival of the Saint, August 18th, notwithstanding
the fact that St. Helena herself was a woman,
and that the church owes its existence to her and is also
indebted to her for the piece of the true cross which it
boasts, and which has given it its name. So while men
are permitted to go inside the chapel of St. Helena, women
are stopped at the entrance and only allowed to peer
through the railing. The same degrading discrimination
is made in the Church of S. Prassede (who also was a
woman) as to entering the splendid chapel, Orto del
Paradiso, which contains the column of blood jasper to
which Christ was bound, and which was "given by the
Saracens to Giovanni Colonna, cardinal of this church,
and legate of the Crusade, because when he had fallen
into their hands and was about to be put to death, he
was rescued by a marvellous intervention of celestial
light." Females are never allowed to enter this chapel
except upon Sundays in Lent, but are permitted to look
at the relic through a grating.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Four Other
Stones of
Great
Interest.</div>

<p>The mention of this column reminds me of
the two columns in the Church of S. Maria
Transpontina, on the other side of the Tiber,
near St. Peter's, which bear inscriptions stating
that they were the pillars to which St. Peter and St.
Paul were fastened, respectively, when they suffered flagellation
by order of Nero. A little farther on towards St.
Peter's is the Piazza Scossa Cavalli, with a pretty fountain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
"Its name bears witness to a curious legend, which
tells how when S. Helena returned from Palestine, bringing
with her the stone on which Abraham was about to
sacrifice Isaac, and that on which the Virgin Mary sat
down at the time of the presentation of the Saviour in the
temple, the horses drawing these precious relics stood still
at this spot, and refused every effort to make them move.
Then Christian people, 'recognizing the finger of God,'
erected a church on this spot&mdash;<i>S. Giacomo Scossa Cavalli</i>&mdash;where
the stones are still to be seen."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hardness
of St. Peter's
Knees.</div>

<p>While speaking of interesting stones, I must
not omit to mention those in the Church of
S. Francesca Romana, near the Forum, containing
the marks of the knees of St. Peter&mdash;(which
show, by the way, that this apostle was a giant in size)&mdash;when
he knelt to pray that Simon Magus might be
dropped by the demons he had invoked to support him in
the air in fulfilment of his promise to fly. One of these
stones used to lie in the <i>Via Sacra</i>, and the water which
collected in the two holes or knee prints was looked upon
as so potent a remedy of disease that groups of infirm
people used to gather around them on the approach of a
shower. According to the legend, the place where Peter
knelt when he thus effected the discomfiture of Simon
Magus and brought him to the ground with such force
that his thigh was fractured, never to be healed, was the
ancient <i>Via Sacra</i>. But, after the priests had removed
the stone from the roadway into the church, the inconsiderate
and iconoclastic explorers of our day, who have
made so many discoveries in their excavations about the
Forum, proved that the roadway from which this relic
was taken was not the ancient <i>Via Sacra</i> at all, but a
more modern roadway which had been mistaken for it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Hardness
of St. Peter's
Head.</div>

<p>In the Mamertine Prisons, which are also
quite close to the Forum, a depression on
the stone wall by which we descend to the
lower dungeon is shown as the spot against which St.
Peter's head rested, though our guide had just told us that
these stairs were not in existence then and prisoners were
let down into the dungeon through the hole in the middle
of the stone floor. Such trifling discrepancies do not
seem to trouble the average Italian mind.</p>

<p>St. Peter and St. Paul are said to have been bound in
this prison for nine months to a pillar, which is shown
here. "A fountain of excellent water beneath the floor
of the prison is attributed to the prayers of St. Peter,
that he might have wherewith to baptize his gaolers, Processus
and Martinianus; but, unfortunately for this ecclesiastical
tradition, the fountain is described by Plutarch
as having existed at the time of Jugurtha's imprisonment"
here, long before the time of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Another miraculous spring, still flowing, is shown in
the Church of SS. Cosmo and Damiano as that which
burst forth in answer to the prayers of Felix IV., that he
might have water to baptize his disciples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What the Head
of St. Paul
Did.</div>

<p>But the most interesting of all the miraculous
springs in or around Rome are the three
fountains, about two miles from the city,
where the Apostle Paul was executed. When his head
was severed from his body it bounded from the earth
three times, crying out thrice, "Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!" A
fountain burst from the ground at each of the three spots
where the severed head struck. It is asserted, in proof
of this origin of the fountains, that the water of the first
is still warm, of the second tepid, and of the third cold,
but we drank of them one after another without being
able to detect any difference in temperature. The apostle's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
head is shown in bas relief upon the three altars above
the fountains. In the church which has been built over
them we were shown the pillar to which he was bound,
and the block of marble upon which he was decapitated,
and, in the vault of another church hard by, the prison in
which he was placed just before his execution.</p>

<p>We could not help asking the priest who was our
escort whether this extraordinary story was still believed.
His answer was: "Certainly! There is no reason whatever
to doubt it. The facts have been handed down in
an unbroken succession from eye-witnesses," a position
which he proceeded to defend at length and with great
warmth when one of our party in particular manifested
much slowness to believe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Paul's Use
of Plautilla's
Veil.</div>

<p>Furthermore, the opening of these three
fountains was not the only miracle wrought
by the apostle after his death. Mrs. Jameson
says: "The legend of his death relates that a certain
Roman matron named Plautilla, one of the converts of
S. Peter, placed herself on the road by which S. Paul
passed to his martyrdom, to behold him for the last time;
and when she saw him she wept greatly and besought his
blessing. The apostle then, seeing her faith, turned to
her, and begged that she would give him her veil to blind
his eyes when he should be beheaded, promising to return
it to her after his death. The attendants mocked at such
a promise; but Plautilla, with a woman's faith and
charity, taking off her veil, presented it to him. After his
martyrdom, S. Paul appeared to her and restored the veil,
stained with his blood. In the ancient representations of
the martyrdom of S. Paul, the legend of Plautilla is
seldom omitted. In the picture by Giotto in the Sacristy
of S. Peter's, Plautilla is seen on an eminence in the background,
receiving the veil from the hands of S. Paul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
who appears in the clouds above; the same representation,
but little varied, is executed in bas-relief on the
bronze doors of St. Peter's."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Footprints
of Christ
in Stone.</div>

<p>About two miles northeast of the Three
Fountains, and the same distance from the
city, on the Appian Way, stands the Church
of St. Sebastian. Over an altar on the right, as you
enter, the attendant priest, drawing aside a curtain, shows
you a slab of dark red stone with two enormous footprints
on it. These, we are told, were made by the feet
of Christ during an interview with Peter which took place
near here, on the site of the small Church of Domine
Quo Vadis. The story is as follows: After the burning
of Rome, Nero charged the Christians with having fired
the city. Straightway the first persecution broke forth,
and many of the Christians were put to death with dreadful
torture. The survivors besought Peter not to expose
his life. As he fled along the Appian Way, Christ appeared
to him travelling towards the city. The fleeing
apostle exclaimed in amazement, "<i>Domine, quo vadis?</i>"
(Lord, whither goest thou?), to which, with a look of
mild sadness, the Saviour replied, "<i>Venio iterum crucifigi</i>"
(I come to be crucified a second time), then vanished,
whereupon the apostle, ashamed of his weakness, returned
to Rome, and shortly afterwards was crucified there himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chains of
St. Peter.</div>

<p>Another relic of great interest connected
with the same apostle is shown in the
Church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, in Rome, and indeed
gives the church its name. The church is not without
interest for other reasons. For instance, it possesses portions
of the crosses of St. Peter and St. Andrew, and we
are told that the high altar covers the remains of the
seven Maccabean brothers. But the basilica is specially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
famous for the possession of the greatest masterpiece of
sculpture since the time of the Greeks&mdash;the majestic
"Moses" of Michelangelo, which draws thousands of
sightseers who might otherwise never set foot in the
building. Nevertheless, its chief attraction, to the devout
Roman Catholic mind, is neither the bones of the Maccabees
nor the statue of Moses, but the chains referred to
in the following familiar passage of Scripture: "Peter
therefore was kept in prison; but prayer was made without
ceasing of the church unto God for him. And when
Herod would have brought him forth, the same night
Peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two
chains; and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
And behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and
a light shined in the prison; and he smote Peter on the
side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And
his chains fell off from his hands." (Acts xii. 5-7.)
These two chains were presented by Juvenal, Bishop of
Jerusalem, to the Empress Eudoxia, wife of Theodosius
the younger, who placed one of them in the Basilica of
the apostles in Constantinople and sent the other to Rome,
where this church was erected as its special shrine. This
was about the middle of the fifth century. "But the
Romans could not rest satisfied with the possession of half
the relic; and within the walls of this very basilica, Leo I.
beheld in a vision the miraculous and mystical uniting
of the two chains, since which they have both been exhibited
here, and the day of their being soldered together
by invisible power, August 1st, has been kept sacred in
the Latin church!" "They are of unequal size, owing to
many fragments of one of them (first whole links, then
only filings) having been removed in the course of centuries
by various popes and sent to Christian princes who
have been esteemed worthy of the favor! The longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
is about five feet in length. At the end of one of them
is a collar, which is said to have encircled the neck of
St. Peter. They are exposed on the day of the 'station'
(the first Monday in Lent) in a reliquary presented by
Pius IX., adorned with statuettes of St. Peter and the
Angel&mdash;to whom he is represented as saying, '<i>Ecce nunc
scio vere</i>' (Acts xii. II). On the following day a priest
gives the chains to be kissed by the pilgrims, and touches
their foreheads with them, saying, 'By the intercession of
the blessed Apostle Peter, may God preserve you from
evil. Amen.'"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Benefits
of Buying a
Fac-simile
of the Chains.</div>

<p>In the sacristy we found a young priest
doing a thriving business in copies of the
relic. We bought from him "an iron <i>fac-simile</i>
of the chains (about the size of an
ordinary watch-chain), authenticated by a certificate testifying
to its having touched the original chains. On the
back of this certificate was printed an extract from the
Rules of the Confraternity of the chains of St. Peter, from
which we learned that all associates in this brotherhood
must wear such a <i>fac-simile</i> as we had just bought, that
the objects of the Confraternity are "The propagation of
the veneration of the chains of St. Peter, an increase of
devotion to the Holy See, prayers for the Pope's intention,
for the needs of Holy Church, the conversion of
infidels and sinners, and the extirpation of heresy and
blasphemy," and that Pius IX. had granted to the members
of the Confraternity various indulgences, one of
which is "<i>A plenary indulgence and remission of all sins</i>
<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>

feast and sunset of the said days, or on August 1st, or
any one of the seven days following it. The usual prayers
for the Holy Father's intention," etc., are comprised in
these visits. We are told also that "the foregoing indulgences
are applicable to the souls in purgatory."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Relics in
St. Peter's
Cathedral.</div>

<p>We may close this running account of the
relics at Rome with a brief mention of those
that are to be seen in St. Peter's itself, the
largest and costliest church in the world. The construction
of it extended over one hundred and seventy-six
years. The cost of the main building alone was fifty
million dollars. The annual outlay for repairs is thirty-one
thousand five hundred dollars. But it cost the
Romish Church far more than money&mdash;it cost her the
loss of all the leading nations of the world, which had
been under her dominion till that time. For the expense
of the vast structure, with its "insolent opulence of marbles,"
was so great that Julius II. and Leo X. were obliged
to meet the enormous outlay by the sale of indulgences,
and that, as is well known, precipitated the Reformation.
So that Protestants may well feel a peculiar interest in
this mighty cathedral.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Column
against which
Christ Leaned
in the Temple.</div>

<p>It goes without saying that the popes would
not allow the chief church of Roman Catholicism
to go begging in the matter of
relics. And, sure enough, we have no
sooner pushed aside the heavy padded screen and stepped
within than we find on our right the Chapel of the Holy
Column, so called because it contains a pillar which is
declared to have been that against which our Lord leaned
when he prayed and taught in the temple at Jerusalem.
The pillar contains this inscription: "Haec est illa columna
in qua DNS N<sup>r</sup> Jesus XPS appodiatus dum populo prædicabat
et Deo pno preces in templo effundebat adhaerendo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>

reverendissimum prem et Dominum Dominum Card. de
Ursinis. A. D. MDCCCXXVIII."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Chair of
St. Peter.</div>

<p>At the other end of the church we are
shown an ancient wooden chair, encrusted
with ivory, which we are told was the Cathedra Petri,
the episcopal throne of St. Peter and his immediate successors.
A magnificent festival in honor of this chair has
been annually celebrated here for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>My party seems to be made up of very determined
Protestants. At any rate, the sight of this relic leads
an inquisitive person in the party to ask whether the
Bible does not say that "Peter's wife's mother lay sick
of a fever."</p>

<p>"Yes," replies the unfortunate gentleman to whose lot
it falls to answer all questions of all kinds.</p>

<p>"Then," continues the Inquisitive Person, "Peter was
married?"</p>

<p>Unfortunate Gentleman: "Yes."</p>

<p>I. P.: "Do the Popes still marry?"</p>

<p>U. G.: "No."</p>

<p>I. P.: "If 'the first Pope' was married, why should
not his successors be married, and why should they insist
upon a celibate clergy in every age, in every country, and
under all circumstances?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Bones of
St. Peter.</div>

<p>U. G.: "These questions are becoming too

portion of St. Peter's being in the Church of St. John

Lateran and the other portion of St. Paul's at the magnificent
basilica of St. Paul's without the walls."</p>

<p>"A circle of eighty-six gold lamps is always burning
around the tomb of the poor fisherman of Galilee....
Hence one can gaze up into the dome, with its huge
letters in purple-blue mosaic upon a gold ground (each
six feet long)&mdash;Tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram
ædificabo ecclesiam meam, et tibi dabo claves regni coelorum.'
Above this are four colossal mosaics of the Evangelists....
The pen of St. Luke is seven feet in
length."</p>

<p>But we must not permit ourselves to be diverted from
our proper subject by the vastness and splendor of the
building, natural as it is to do so when standing under this
matchless dome. The four huge piers which support the
dome are used as shrines for the four great relics of the
church, viz.: 1. The lance of St. Longinus, the soldier
who pierced the Saviour's side; 2. A portion of the true
cross; 3. The napkin of St. Veronica, containing the
miraculous impression of our Lord's face; and 4. The
head of the apostle Andrew.</p>

<p>I did not see these relics myself, as I was in the East
when they were exhibited, but on April 11th, the day
before Easter, other members of my party did, that is,
they saw all of them but Andrew's head, and from a
letter written me by the youngest of my correspondents
in my own family, giving not only description, but drawings
of the spear head, the cross and the handkerchief in
their several frames, I infer that, notwithstanding the
great height of the Veronica balcony from which they are
exhibited, my young correspondent and his companions
fared better in the matter of a good view than Fritz
in <i>Chronicles of the Schönberg Cotta Family</i>, who says:
"To-day we gazed on the Veronica&mdash;the holy impression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
left by our Saviour's face on the cloth S. Veronica presented
to him to wipe his brow, bowed under the weight
of the cross. We had looked forward to this sight for
days, for seven thousand years of indulgence from penance
are attached to it. But when the moment came we
could see nothing but a black board hung with a cloth,
before which another white cloth was held. In a few
minutes this was withdrawn, and the great moment was
over, the glimpse of the sacred thing on which hung the
fate of seven thousand years."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Manufacture
of St.
Philomena.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Before</span> quitting the subject of the relics at Rome, I
must give my readers what Hare calls "the extraordinary
history of the manufacture of S. Filomena, now
one of the most popular saints in Italy, and one towards
whom idolatry is carried out with frantic
enthusiasm both at Domo d'Ossola and in
some of the Neapolitan States."</p>

<p>"In the year 1802, while some excavations were going
forward in the Catacombs of Priscilla, a sepulchre was
discovered containing the skeleton of a young female;
on the exterior were rudely painted some of the symbols
constantly recurring in these chambers of the dead&mdash;an
anchor, an olive branch (emblems of Hope and Peace),
a scourge, two arrows, and a javelin; above them the
following inscription, of which the beginning and end
were destroyed:</p>

<p class="center">
&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Lumena Pax Te Cum Fi</span>"&mdash;
</p>

<p>The remains, reasonably supposed to be those of one of
the early martyrs for the faith, were sealed up and deposited
in the treasury of relics in the Lateran; here they
remained for some years unthought of. On the return
of Pius VII. from France, a Neapolitan prelate was sent
to congratulate him. One of the priests in his train, who
wished to create a sensation in his district, where the long
residence of the French had probably caused some decay
of piety, begged for a few relics to carry home, and these
recently discovered remains were bestowed on him; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
inscription was translated somewhat freely to signify
<i>Santa Philomena, rest in peace</i>. Another priest, whose
name is suppressed, <i>because of his great humility</i>, was
favored by a vision in the broad noonday, in which he
beheld the glorious virgin Filomena, who was pleased to
reveal to him that she had suffered death for preferring
the Christian faith and her vow of chastity to the addresses
of the emperor, who wished to make her his wife.
This vision leaving much of her history obscure, a certain
young artist, whose name is also suppressed, perhaps because
of his great humility, was informed in a vision
that the emperor alluded to was Diocletian, and at the
same time the torments and persecutions suffered by the
Christian virgin Filomena, as well as her wonderful constancy,
were also revealed to him. There were some
difficulties in the way of the Emperor Diocletian, which
<i>incline</i> the writer of the <i>historical</i> account to incline to the
opinion that the young artist in his wisdom <i>may</i> have
made a mistake, and that the emperor may have been not
Diocletian, but Maximian. The facts, however, now admitted
of no doubt; the relics were carried by the priest
Francesco da Lucia to Naples; they were enclosed in a
case of wood resembling in form the human body; this
figure was habited in a petticoat of white satin, and over
it a crimson tunic after the Greek fashion; the face was
painted to represent nature, a garland of flowers was
placed on the head, and in the hands a lily and a javelin
with the point reversed, to express her purity and her
martyrdom; then she was laid in a half-sitting posture
in a sarcophagus, of which the sides were glass, and, after
lying for some time in state in the chapel of the Torres
family in the Church of Sant' Angiolo, she was carried in
grand procession to Mugnano, a little town about twenty
miles from Naples, amid the acclamations of the people,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
working many and surprising miracles by the way....
Such is the legend of S. Filomena, and such the authority
on which she has become within the last twenty years
one of the most popular saints in Italy."&mdash;<i>Mrs. Jameson's
Sacred and Legendary Art</i>, p. 671.</p>

<p>But, after all, the most extraordinary case of saint-manufacture
is not that of Philomena, but that of
<i>Buddha</i>! I have not room for the story here, but if any
one wishes to know how the papacy made Buddha a
Christian saint, he will find the whole story, with the
proofs, in <i>A History of the Warfare of Science and
Theology</i>, by Andrew D. White, LL. D., late President
and Professor of History at Cornell University, and until
recently United States Ambassador to Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"The Courteous
Spaniard."</div>

<p>A few days ago we visited the Church of
St. Laurence Without the Walls, where in
a silver shrine under the high altar, the remains of St.
Laurence and St. Stephen are said to rest. The walls
of the portico of the church are covered with a series
of frescoes, lately repainted. One series represents the
story of St. Stephen and that of the translation of his
relics to this church. "The relics of St. Stephen were
preserved at Constantinople, whither they had been transported
from Jerusalem by the Empress Eudoxia, wife of
Theodosius II. Hearing that her daughter, Eudoxia, wife
of Valentinian II., Emperor of the West, was afflicted
with a devil, she begged her to come to Constantinople,
that her demon might be driven out by the touch of the
relics. The younger Eudoxia wished to comply, but the
devil refused to leave her unless St. Stephen was brought
to Rome. An agreement was therefore made that the
relics of St. Stephen should be exchanged for those of
St. Laurence. St. Stephen arrived, and the Empress was
immediately relieved of her devil; but when the persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
who had brought the relics of St. Stephen from Constantinople
were about to take those of St. Laurence back
with them, they all fell down dead! Pope Pelagius
prayed for their restoration to life, which was granted
for a short time, to prove the efficacy of prayer, but they
all died again ten days later! Thus the Romans knew
that it would be criminal to fulfil their promise, and part
with the relics of St. Laurence, and the bodies of the two
martyrs were laid in the same sarcophagus." And thus
we know how much more the Romans think of relics
than of honor and truth. "It is related that when they
opened the sarcophagus, and lowered into it the body
of St. Stephen, St. Laurence moved on one side, giving
the place of honor on the right hand to St. Stephen;
hence, the common people of Rome have conferred on
St. Laurence the title of '<i>Il cortese Spagnuolo</i>'&mdash;the
courteous Spaniard."</p>

<p>Another series of these pictures in the portico represents
the story of a sacristan who, coming to pray in this
church before day, found it filled with worshippers, and
was told by St. Laurence himself that they were the
Apostle Peter, the first martyr, Stephen, and other apostles,
martyrs and virgins from paradise, and was ordered
to go and tell the Pope what he had seen, and bid him
come and celebrate a solemn mass. The sacristan objected
that the Pope would not believe him, and asked
for some visible sign. Then St. Laurence ungirt his robe
and gave him his girdle. When the Pope was accompanying
him back to the basilica they met a funeral procession.
To test the powers of the girdle, the Pope laid it on the
bier, and at once the dead arose and walked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Miracles of
St. Dominic.</div>

<p>That is not the only miracle of resurrection
offered to our credulity by these ecclesiastical
legends. The three principal frescoes in the chapter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
house of the church of St. Sisto, recently painted by the
Padre Besson, represent three miracles of St. Dominic&mdash;in
each case of raising from the dead&mdash;the subjects being
a mason who had fallen from a scaffold when building
this monastery, a child, and the young Lord Napoleone
Orsini, who had been thrown from his horse and instantly
killed, and who was brought to life by St. Dominic on
this spot, as is further commemorated by an inscription
on the wall. But miracles were nothing uncommon in
the history of the founder of the powerful Dominican
Order. In the refectory of St. Marco, at Florence, we
had seen the fine fresco which represents the miraculous
provision made for him and his forty friars at a time of
scarcity by two angels. The refectory in which this miracle
took place is at the Church of St. Sabina, on the
Aventine, in Rome; but there are three other things at
this church which interested us hardly less than the scene
of that miracle. One of them is the huge, pumpkin-shaped,
black stone, two or three times as big as a man's
head, which the devil is said to have hurled at St. Dominic
one day when he found him lying prostrate in prayer.
This stone is the most conspicuous object in the church,
being set up on a pillar about three feet high, right in
the middle of the nave. Not far away is the marble
slab on which the saint was lying at the time that the
formidable missile was thrown. The adversary's aim was
not good, and the saint was not harmed. The second
thing of chief interest here is the Chapel of the Rosary,
at the other end of the same aisle in which the marble slab
lies, built on the very spot where St. Dominic had the
vision in which he received the rosary from the hands of
the Virgin. The supernatural gift is commemorated in a
beautiful painting by Sassoferato. It is hardly necessary
to explain to any of my readers that a rosary is a string
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of beads used by Roman Catholics to keep the count of
the number of <i>Pater-nosters</i> and <i>Ave-Marias</i> which they
repeat, and that this manner of "vain repetitions" was
first used by the Dominicans among Roman Catholics,
though the custom was really borrowed from the Mohammedans
and Brahmins, who still use rosaries. The third
object is the famous orange tree, now six hundred and
seventy years old, which is said to have been brought
from Spain and planted in the court here by St. Dominic
himself, orange trees having been unknown in Rome before
that time, and "which still lives, and is firmly believed
to flourish or fail with the fortunes of the Dominican
Order." Ladies are not allowed to approach this tree,
so, as there were ladies in our party, we all contented
ourselves with a look at it through a window. Hard by,
of course, there is a room where things are sold to pilgrims
and visitors. There we bought a rosary, the beads
of which are made of the fruit of the plant called the
Thorn of Christ, with the exception of the bead next to
the cross, which is a tiny dried orange from St. Dominic's
tree. Enclosed in the cross are a little piece of the wood
of the tree, and some earth from the catacombs where the
bodies of Sts. Peter and Paul, and of the holy virgin
martyrs, Sts. Agnes and Cecilia, reposed for some time.
The printed leaflet which accompanies our purchase tells
us that "these rosaries, when sold or ordered, are blessed
and enriched with the indulgences of the Rosary Confraternity
and the papal blessing. When blessed they may
be distributed; <i>but if resold they lose all the indulgences</i>."
(Italics ours.)</p>

<p>Still another relic of great interest in this convent of
St. Sabina is the crucifix of Michele Ghislieri (afterwards
Pope Pius V.). "One day, as Ghislieri was about to kiss
his crucifix, in the eagerness of prayer, the image of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
Christ, says the legend, retired of its own accord from his
touch, for it had been poisoned by an enemy, and a kiss
would have been death."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sundry
Miracles
by Other
Saints, and
Images.</div>

<p>In the Church of St. Gregory, on the C&oelig;lian
Hill, the thing that interested us most was
the picture by Badalocchi, "commemorating
a miracle on this spot, when, at the moment
of elevation, the Host is said to have bled
in the hands of St. Gregory, to convince an unbeliever
of the truth of transubstantiation." This is the same
Gregory who presented certain foreign ambassadors with
a handful of earth from the arena of the Coliseum as a
relic for their sovereigns, so many martyrs having suffered
death there, and "upon their receiving the gift with
disrespect, he pressed it, when blood flowed from the
soil."</p>

<p>Not far from the Church of St. Gregory we were
shown the hermitage where St. Giovanni de Matha lived.
"Before he came to reside here he had been miraculously
brought from Tunis (whither he had gone on a mission)
to Ostia, in a boat without helm or sail, in which he
knelt without ceasing before the crucifix throughout the
whole of his voyage!"</p>

<p>Time would fail me to tell of the miraculous surgical
operation performed by Sts. Cosmo and Damian upon a
man who was praying in the church dedicated to them,
and who had a diseased leg amputated without pain by
the good saints while he slept; and not only so, but had
a sound leg, which they had taken from the body of a
man just buried, substituted for the diseased one. Nor
can I dwell on the miraculous blindness with which the
guard sent to seize Pope St. Martin I. was stricken the
moment he caught sight of the pontiff in St. Maria Maggiore,
or the miraculous tears shed by an image of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
Virgin attached to a neighboring wall when she saw a
cruel murder committed in the street below, or the madonnas
and crucifixes that spoke to saints on various occasions.
One of these, however, is too significant to be
omitted altogether. There is in the Church of St. Agostino
a sculptured image of the Madonna and child. "It
is not long since the report was spread that one day a
poor woman called upon this image of the Madonna for
help; it began to speak, and replied, 'If I had only something,
then I could help thee, but I myself am so poor!'
This story was circulated, and very soon throngs of credulous
people hastened hither to kiss the foot of the Madonna,
<i>and to present her with all kinds of gifts</i>." (Italics
mine.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the Papal
Treasury
was Filled,
and how it
was Emptied.</div>

<p>The evil methods employed at various times
to replenish the papal treasury are known
to all readers of history. The best known,
perhaps, is the shameless traffic in indulgences
by Tetzel, which helped to precipitate
the Reformation. Hare closes his account of the execution
of Beatrice Cenci for complicity in the murder of
her father with the statement that "sympathy will always
follow one who sinned under the most terrible of provocations,
and whose cruel death was due to the avarice of
Clement VIII. for the riches which the church acquired
by the confiscation of the Cenci property," and cites the
petition of Gaspare Guizza (1601), in which he claims a
reward from the Pope for his service in apprehending
one of the assassins of Francesco Cenci, on the ground
that thus "the other accomplices and their confessions
were secured, and <i>so many thousands of crowns brought
into the papal treasury</i>." The venality of Pope Alexander
VI., Rodrigo Borgia (1492-1503), "the wicked and
avaricious father of Cæsar and Lucretia, who is believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
to have died of the poison which he intended for one of
his cardinals," is thus hit off by Pasquino:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"Vendit Alexander claves, altaria, Christum;</div>
    <div class="verse">Emerat ille prius, vendere jure potest."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Of Innocent X. (1644-'55), Pasquino says, "Magis amat
Olympiam quam Olympium," referring to the shameful
relations existing between this Pope and his avaricious
sister-in-law, Olympia Maidalchini, who made it her business
to secure the profits of the papacy in hard cash.
Trollope, in his <i>Life of Olympia</i>, says: "No appointment
to office of any kind was made except in consideration
of a proportionable sum paid down into her own coffers.
This often amounted to three or four years' revenue of
the place to be granted. Bishoprics and benefices were
sold as fast as they became vacant. One story is told
of an unlucky disciple of Simon, who in treating with the
Pope for a valuable see, just fallen vacant, and hearing
from her a price at which it might be his, far exceeding
all he could command, persuaded the members of his
family to sell all they had for the purpose of making this
profitable investment. The price was paid, and the
bishopric was given him, but, with a fearful resemblance
to the case of Ananias, he died within the year, and his
ruined family saw the see a second time sold by the insatiable
and incorrigible Olympia.... During the last
year of Innocent's life, Olympia literally hardly ever
quitted him. Once a week, we read, she left the Vatican,
secretly by night, accompanied by several porters carrying
sacks of coins, the proceeds of the week's extortions and
sales, to her own palace. And during these short absences
she used to lock the Pope into his chamber, and take the
key with her!" She finally "deserted him on his death-bed,
making off with the accumulated spoils of his ten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
years' papacy, which enabled her son, Don Camillo, to
build the Palazzo Doria Pamfili, in the Corso, and the
beautiful Villa Doria Pamfili," west of the Janiculan Hill.
This villa, with its casino, garden, lake, fountain, pine-shaded
lawns and woods, and its fine view of St. Peter's
standing out against the green Campagna beyond, and the
blue Sabine mountains in the distance, is to this day one
of the loveliest villas in Italy, and the favorite resort of
the latter-day Romans and visitors to their city on the
two afternoons of the week on which it is open to pedestrians
and two-horse carriages.</p>

<p>The notorious Simony practiced by the popes, in
which, as we have just seen, Olympia became such an
adept, gave rise to the biting Latin couplet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse">"An Petrus Romæ fuerit, sub judice lis est;</div>
    <div class="verse">Simonem Romæ nemo fuisse negat."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Some of the modern methods of making use of the Pope
for purposes of gain are less objectionable than those of
Olympia. Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his <i>Roman Catholic
Church in Italy</i>, just published, says: "One of the
very latest novelties of the 'Pope's Shop' is a penny-in-the-slot
blessing machine. Specimens of this were lately
to be seen in the Corso, Rome, about half way between the
Piazza Colonna and the Piazza del Popolo. A penny is
dropped into it. The cinematograph, or wheel of life,
goes round, when, lo! there appears a long procession
of richly clothed cardinals and monsignori, and then the
Pope in a sedan chair, accompanied by his Swiss Guards.
As he is carried past the spectator, he turns towards the
window of his chair, a smile overspreads his face, he raises
his hands, and gives his blessing. On these machines
there is an inscription to the effect that the blessing thus
given and received is equivalent to that given by the Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
in person in St. Peter's. Truly a novel way of turning an
honest penny!" We hear that a rash churchman, not
liking the facts just stated, undertook to deny them in the
public prints, when up spoke some English gentlemen,
who had been in Rome recently, and bowled the churchman
over with the statement that they had themselves
seen this blessing machine on the Corso.</p>

<p>One never touches this subject of the vast wealth of
the papacy without calling to mind the well-known rejoinder
of the great theologian, Thomas Aquinas, when
the Pope was showing him all his money and riches, and
said, "You see, Thomas, the church cannot now say what
it said in early times, 'Silver and gold have I none.'"
"No," answered Aquinas, "nor can it say, 'Rise up and
walk'" (Acts iii. 6). This loss of spiritual power, this
loss of ability to minister salvation to others, is one of
the most melancholy results of the corruption of the
papacy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some Ugly
Things in
the Lives of
the Popes.</div>

<p>Dr. Alexander Robertson, in his recent book
on <i>The Roman Catholic Church in Italy</i>,
which has received the hearty approval of
the King of Italy and his Prime Minister,
says: "There are few, I daresay, who have looked into
the history of the popes, no matter what their religious
faith may be, who will not agree with me when I say that
it does not afford pleasant reading. One's intellect rebels
against their preposterous claims and pretensions, and
one's moral sense against their character and lives.
Amongst them there were some good men, some learned
men, and some really able men; but, taking them all in
all, they were, beyond doubt, amongst the lowest class of
men to be found on the pages of history. To wade
through their lives is to cross a pestiferous moral swamp
of worldliness, simony, nepotism, concubinage, personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
animosities, sanguinary feuds, forged decretals, plunderings,
poisonings, assassinations, massacres, death."
<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>One may smile at such papal peccadilloes as the vanity
of Paul II., who was chiefly remarkable for his personal
beauty, and was so vain of his appearance that, when he
was elected Pope, he wished to take the name of Formosus.
One may be amused at the intense self-esteem
of Urban VIII., of whose spoliation of ancient Rome
Pasquino says, "Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt
Barberini," and who, in the Barberini palace, had the
Virgin and angels represented as bringing in the ornaments
of the papacy at his coronation, and in another
room a number of the Barberini bees (the family crest)
flocking against the sun, and eclipsing it&mdash;to symbolize
the splendor of the family. But our feeling changes when
we read that "he issued a bull by which the name, estates
and privileges of his house might pass to any living male
descendant, legitimate or illegitimate, whether child of
prince or priest," lest the family of Barberini might become
absorbed in that of Colonna. And we do not go
far in our reading about such popes before the feeling
of amusement yields to one of sadness, indignation and
horror. We need not insist upon the story of the female
Pope Joan, who is said to have secured her election to
the papal throne disguised as a man, and to have reigned
two years as John VIII., and then to have died a shameful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
death; for, notwithstanding the indisputable fact that till
1600 her head was included among the terra cotta representations
of the other popes in the Cathedral of Sienna,
and was inscribed "Johannes VIII., Femina de Anglia,"
and that it was then changed into a head of Pope Zacharias
by the Grand Duke, at the request of Pope Clement
VIII., the story is now generally discredited. But there
are many other facts, established beyond controversy,
which explain fully the feeling of the great majority of
the Italian people and the verdict of the accredited historians
of the world. When the penitential Pope, Adrian
VI. (1522-'23), died of drinking too much beer, "the
house of his physician was hung with garlands by midnight
revellers, and decorated with the inscription, Liberatori
Patriæ, S. P. Q. R.'" The nepotism of the
learned, brilliant and witty Paul III. "induced him to
form Parma into a duchy for his natural son Pierluigui,
to build the Farnese Palace, and to marry his grandson
Ottavio to Marguerite, natural daughter of Charles V."
John XII., the first Pope who took a new name, "scandalized
Christendom by a life of murder, robbery, adultery
and incest." Of the tombs of the eighty-seven popes
who were buried in the old basilica of St. Peter's, only
two were replaced when the present building was erected,
those of the two popes who lived in the time and excited
the indignation of Savonarola&mdash;"Sixtus IV., with whose
cordial concurrence the assassination of Lorenzo de'
Medici was attempted, and Innocent VIII., the main
object of whose policy was to secure place and power
for his illegitimate children," sixteen in number, and who
is represented on his tomb as holding in his hand the
spear of "St. Longinus," which had pierced the side of
Christ. This spear was sent to Innocent VIII. by the
Sultan Bajazet, nearly fifteen hundred years after the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
crucifixion, and, as we have already seen, is now preserved
in St. Peter's as one of its four chief relics.
Guicciardini says of the death of Alexander VI.: "All
Rome ran with indescribable gladness to visit the corpse.
Men could not satiate their eyes with feeding on the carcase
of the serpent who, by his unbounded ambition and
pestiferous perfidy, by every demonstration of horrible
cruelty, monstrous lust and unheard-of avarice, selling
without distinction things sacred and profane, had filled
the world with venom."</p>

<p>"Pope Paul V. granted dispensations and pensions to
any persons who would assassinate Fra Paolo Sarpi;
Pope Pius V. offered, as Mr. Froude tells us, 'remission
of sin to them and their heirs, with annuities, honors and
promotions, to any cook, brewer, baker, vintner, physician,
grocer, surgeon, or others,' who would make away with
Queen Elizabeth; and Pope Gregory XIII. offered a high
place in heaven to any one who would murder the Prince
of Orange; and the poor wretch, Balthazar Gerard, who
did the infamous deed, actually told his judges 'that he
would soon be a saint in heaven, and would have the first
place there next to God,' whilst his family received a
patent of nobility, and entered into the possession of the
estate of the Prince in the Franche Comté&mdash;rewards
promised for the commission of the crime by Cardinal
Granvelle." (Dr. Alexander Robertson's <i>Roman Catholic
Church in Italy</i>, p. 94.)</p>

<p>These are some of the things that help to explain not
only the tone of the pasquinades, not only the indictments
of the world's leading historians, which are to be presently
cited, but also the present attitude of something like
twenty millions of the thirty-odd millions of Italy's inhabitants,
who have forsaken the church altogether.</p>

<p>What idea the people have of the Jesuits in particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
is well shown by the legend connected with the Piazza
del Gesu, the great open space in front of the Jesuit
church, which is considered the windiest place in Rome.
The story is that the devil and the wind were one day
taking a walk together. "When they came to this square,
the devil, who seemed to be very devout, said to the
wind, 'Just wait a minute, mio caro, while I go into this
church.' So the wind promised, and the devil went into
the Gesu, and has never come out again&mdash;and the wind
is blowing about in the Piazza del Gesu to this day."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pasquino's
View of
the Pope.</div>

<p>One of the interesting objects in Rome is
a mutilated statue called Pasquino, which
stands at the corner of the Orsini Palace,
one of the most central and public places in the city. The
reason for the interest attaching to this almost shapeless
piece of marble is that for centuries it was used for
placarding those satires upon the popes which, by their
exceeding cleverness and biting truth, have made the
name of pasquinade famous the world over. No squib
that was ever affixed to that column had a keener edge
than the one known as "The Antithesis of Christ," which
appeared at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and
runs as follows:</p>

<p class="bq">
Christ said, "My kingdom is not of this world."<br />
The Pope conquers cities by force.<br />
<br />

The Pope has his kissed by kings.<br />
<br />

<div class="sidenote">What the
Italians
now Think
about it.</div>

<p>"But," some one may say, "the pasquinades
were written long ago, and, while they are
doubtless true descriptions of the papacy of
the past, surely no one would take the same
view now." For answer I may quote the statement of
Dr. Raffaelle Mariano, Professor of Philosophy in the
University of Naples, who is not a Protestant, but, as he
tells us, was "born in the Roman Catholic Church," and
was "a fervent Catholic from infancy." Speaking of the
vast difference which he found between the teachings of
the church and those of the New Testament as to what
is necessary to salvation, he says, "Therefore, Roman
Catholicism is not only not Christianity, but it is the very
antithesis of Christianity," a statement every whit as
strong as Pasquino's. Some American Protestants, especially
those who have personal friends in the Roman
Catholic Church whom they honor and love&mdash;and there
are many people in that church who are richly worthy
of honor and love, and who do not approve of the
evils we have been describing any more than we do&mdash;are
sometimes disposed to think that Protestant writers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
are too severe in their condemnation of the Romish
Church as a system. A visit to Italy, the centre of Romanism,
would quickly disabuse these overcharitable
Protestants of that impression. We have all read of
such things as are described above in connection with
the relics and legends, but they seem far away and unreal,
and almost impossible, until we come to the home of
Romanism and find them all around us. Then it ceases
to surprise us that so large a proportion of the most
intelligent men in Italy occupy a position of indifference
and unbelief, or hostility and scorn, towards the Christian
religion, for Romanism is the only Christianity that most
of them know. Let it be remembered, too, that the King,
able, conscientious, patriotic, devoted to the welfare of
his people, and the Prime Minister, Zanardelli, like his
predecessor, Crispi, and the members of Parliament, and
the army and navy, and the whole government which has
given Italy such wonderful stability and prosperity since
the overthrow of the papal dominion and opened before
the nation a future of so much promise, are all standing
aloof from the Pope. Let any one see one of the great
pilgrimages from every part of the country to the tomb
of Victor Emmanuel, who freed Italy, as we saw it the
other day, and observe the immense popularity of the
great liberator and his successors of the house of
Savoy, and let him note the firm opposition of Italy's
leading men to the papacy, and he will see that the
view of the Pope which the secular newspapers so persistently
seek to force upon the people of the English-speaking
world simply cannot be that of the thoughtful
men of Italy.</p>

<p>By the way, I see plenty of women confessing to the
priests, but very, very few men. The textbook used in
the training of priests as father-confessors, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
standard work of the church on that subject, approved
by Pope Leo XIII., is Liguori's <i>Moral Philosophy</i>. "On
July 14, 1901, the <i>Asino</i>, a daily newspaper published in
Rome, printed in its columns, and also in the form of large
bills, which it caused to be posted up in public places in
the chief cities of Italy, a challenge offering one thousand
francs to any Roman Catholic newspaper which would
have the courage to print the Latin text, with an Italian
translation, of two passages in Liguori's book, which it
specified. The challenge was never taken up, and it never
will be, for any one daring to publish the passages named
would certainly be prosecuted for outraging public decency"
(Dr. Alexander Robertson, <i>Roman Catholic
Church in Italy</i>, p. 149). Hare says, "It was a curious
characteristic of the laxity of morals in the time of
Julius II. (1503-'13), that her friends did not hesitate to
bury the famous Aspasia of that age in this church (St.
Gregorio), and to inscribe upon her tomb: 'Imperia, cortisana
Romana, quæ digna tanto nomine, raræ inter
homines formæ specimen dedit.'... But this monument
has now been removed."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Most of the facts above cited, especially those concerning
the legends and the Popes, except where specific
acknowledgment is made to other writers, have been
drawn from Hare's invaluable <i>Walks in Rome</i>. Let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
conclude the list with the testimonies of a few eminent
men of unimpeachable competence and veracity as to the
character and influence of the Roman Catholic Church as
a system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Macaulay,
Dickens and
Gladstone on
the Influence
of Romanism.</div>

<p>In the first chapter of his <i>History of England</i>,
Lord Macaulay says: "From the time
when the barbarians overran the Western
Empire to the time of the revival of letters,
the influence of the Church of Rome had
been generally favorable to science, to civilization, to good
government. But during the last three centuries, to stunt
the growth of the human mind has been her chief object.
Throughout Christendom, whatever advance has been
made in knowledge, in freedom, in wealth, and in the arts
of life, has been made in spite of her, and has everywhere
been in inverse proportion to her power. The loveliest
and most fertile provinces of Europe have, under her rule,
been sunk in poverty, in political servitude, and in intellectual
torpor, while Protestant countries, once proverbial
for sterility and barbarism, have been turned by skill and
industry into gardens, and can boast of a long list of
heroes and statesmen, philosophers and poets. Whoever,
knowing what Italy and Scotland naturally are, and what,
four hundred years ago, they actually were, shall now
compare the country round Rome with the country round
Edinburgh, will be able to form some judgment as to the
tendency of papal domination. The descent of Spain,
once the first among the monarchies, to the lowest depths
of degradation, the elevation of Holland, in spite of many
natural disadvantages, to a position such as no commonwealth
so small has ever reached, teach the same lesson.
Whoever passes in Germany from a Roman Catholic to a
Protestant principality, in Switzerland from a Roman
Catholic to a Protestant canton, in Ireland from a Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
Catholic to a Protestant county, finds that he has passed
from a lower to a higher grade of civilization. On the
other side of the Atlantic the same law prevails. The
Protestants of the United States have left far behind them
the Roman Catholics of Mexico, Peru and Brazil. The
Roman Catholics of Lower Canada remain inert, while
the whole continent round them is in a ferment with
Protestant activity and enterprise. The French have
doubtless shown an energy and intelligence which, even
when misdirected, have justly entitled them to be called a
great people. But this apparent exception, when examined,
will be found to confirm the rule, for in no country
that is called Roman Catholic has the Roman Catholic
Church, during several generations, possessed so little
authority as in France."</p>

<p>Charles Dickens, in a letter written from Switzerland,
in 1845, to his friend and biographer, Forster, says: "In
the Simplon, hard by here, where (at the bridge of St.
Maurice over the Rhone) the Protestant canton ends and
a Catholic canton begins, you might separate two perfectly
distinct and different conditions of humanity by
drawing a line with your stick in the dust on the ground.
On the Protestant side&mdash;neatness, cheerfulness, industry,
education, continued aspiration, at least, after better
things. On the Catholic side&mdash;dirt, disease, ignorance,
squalor and misery. I have so constantly observed the
like of this since I came abroad that I have a sad misgiving
that the religion of Ireland lies at the root of all
its sorrows." Writing from Genoa, in 1846, Dickens
says, "If I were a Swiss, with a hundred thousand pounds,
I would be as steady against the Catholic canons and the
propagation of Jesuitism as any Radical among them;
believing the dissemination of Catholicity to be the most
horrible means of political and social degradation left in
the world."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>In connection with Dickens' remark about Ireland,
we may quote the remarkable statement of Mr. Michael
McCarthy, himself a Roman Catholic, in his book, <i>Five
Years in Ireland</i>, pp. 65 and 66, where, after describing
the welcome of the Belfast Corporation to Lord Cadogan
on his first visit, in 1895, to the Protestant North of
Ireland, and their glowing statements about the peaceful
and prosperous condition of their city and district, he
contrasts this happy condition with the unhappy state of
the "rest of Ireland," meaning by that the Roman Catholic
parts. "In the rest of Ireland there is no social or industrial
progress to record. The man who would say of it
that it was 'progressing and prospering,' or that 'its work
people were fully employed,' or that there existed 'a continued
development of its industries,' or that its towns
'had increased in value and population,' would be set
down as a madman. It is in this seven-eighths of Ireland
that the growing and great organization of the Catholic
Church has taken root."</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone, in an article on "Italy and her Church,"
in the <i>Church Quarterly Review</i> for October, 1875, says:
"Profligacy, corruption and ambition, continued for ages,
unitedly and severally, their destructive work upon the
country, through the Curia and the papal chair; and in
doing it they of course have heavily tainted the faith of
which that chair was the guardian." Elsewhere he says,
"There has never been any more cunning blade devised
against the freedom, the virtue and the happiness of a
people than Romanism."</p>

<p>Nathaniel Hawthorne, in his <i>Marble Faun</i>, which, by
the way, contains the most charming of all the descriptive
writing about Rome, put the case none too strongly when
he spoke of being "disgusted with the pretense of holiness
and the reality of nastiness, each equally omnipresent"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
in the city of the popes. The new government has
wrought a great change in this respect, and Rome is in
many parts of it now quite a clean city.</p>

<p>There, then, are the facts as to the influence of the
Roman Catholic Church. I am, of course, very far from
saying that there are no good people in that church. As
I have already stated, I believe that there are many good
people in it, but my own observation has satisfied me
that the verdict of history as to the baleful influence of
the system is absolutely correct.</p>

<p>"What, then," some one may ask, "do the good people
in that church think of all the immoralities and frauds
that it has condoned and fostered?" The answer is that
the really good people in that church must grieve over
them and deplore them just as the good people in other
churches do.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p><i>P. S.</i>&mdash;It is generally believed, and apparently with
good reason, that the new Pope, Pius X., is a better man
than many of his predecessors, and that he cannot be
charged with the immoralities or the ambition and avarice
which characterized them. Let us hope that he will have
the courage to attempt some real reform in the lives of
many of his clergy.</p>

It was a bad day for the cause of truth when Foxe's <i>Book of
Martyrs</i> was allowed to go out of general circulation. When I was
a boy it was no uncommon thing to see copies of it in American
homes. Now it is rarely seen. A new and corrected edition of it
ought to be brought out and given wide circulation. There have
been not a few indications this year that our people are forgetting
some of the most instructive history of all the past, and those who
seem to be most oblivious of it are the editors of some of the
secular newspapers.</p></div>

There are other indications of some improvement in this
matter, but an Anglican resident in Italy, quoted by the <i>Review
of Reviews</i> as "a painstaking and fair-minded" witness, says,
"People are not shocked by clerical immorality, but regard it as
natural and inevitable." To an Anglican friend a Roman prelate
lamented that a certain cardinal was not elected at the late conclave.
But the Anglican replied, "He is a man of conspicuous
immorality." "No doubt," was the answer, "but you Americans
seem to think there is no virtue but chastity. The Cardinal has
not that, but he is an honest man."</p></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">An Audience
with the Pope.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Well</span>, we have seen the Pope. Hearing that a body
of Italian pilgrims were to be received by the
pontiff at the Vatican, and having assured ourselves that
the function was one which would involve no official
recognition of the Pope on our part, and
that we should be merely Protestant spectators,
we gladly accepted the offer of tickets for the audience,
and, supposing in our simplicity that, as the reception
was set for noon, we should be sufficiently early if
we went at eleven o'clock, we drove up to the main entrance
of the Vatican at that hour. There was a great
throng of people about the door, but our tickets obtained
for us immediate entrance along with a stream of other
ladies and gentlemen. The regulation attire for these
functions is full evening dress for gentlemen, while ladies
wear black, with no hat, but with a lace mantilla on the
head. We first passed through a double line of the
famous Swiss Guards, in their extraordinary uniform of
crimson, yellow and black, designed by no less a person
than Michael Angelo. Then we were shown up the great
stairway, and passing through a couple of large rooms,
one of which was adorned with Raphael's frescoes, we
found ourselves at the entrance of a long and spacious
hall, already densely crowded, as it seemed to us, but
with a space kept open down the centre between the rows
of seats on either side. Looking down this open space,
we could see at the other end, on a slightly raised platform,
the pontifical throne, upholstered in red velvet, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
golden back and arms, effectively set in the midst of
crimson hangings, which swept in rich masses from the
lofty ceiling to the floor. Preceded by guards, we travelled
the whole length of the hall, and found, to our great
gratification, that our seats were quite close to the throne,
so that we had an excellent position for seeing and hearing
all that was going on. We soon noticed that many of the
hundreds of people present, like some of us, had not observed
the regulations as to dress. Many others had.
Mingled with the soberer attire of the spectators, pilgrims
and priests, we saw now and then a violet cassock, as
one bishop after another drifted in. Apart from these
vestments, there was no semblance of a religious gathering.
It was more like a social function, and the people
were chatting gaily, the jolliest and noisiest crowd being
a group of young seminarians, prospective priests, who
occupied the same bench with us and the two or three
nearest to it. After we had been there an hour the great
clock of St. Peter's struck twelve. Instantly all the noisy
young seminarians rose to their feet and began to recite,
in a lower, humming tone, their <i>Ave-Marias</i> and <i>Pater-Nosters</i>.
As soon as the reciting and counting of beads
was over, as it was in a minute, they struck in again with
their gay conversation. We had plenty of time to take
it all in. The Pope is always late, and it was an hour
after the time fixed for the audience when he appeared;
but at last he did, and instantly everybody, men and
women, sprang up on the benches and chairs, frantically
waving their handkerchiefs and shouting at the top of
their voices, "<i>Evviva il Papa-Re! Evviva il Papa-Re!</i>"&mdash;"Long
live the Pope-King! Long live the Pope-King!"&mdash;the
ablest performer in this part of the ceremony being
a leather-lunged young priest at my elbow, with a voice
as powerful and persistent as that of a hungry calf, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
who made known his desire for the restoration of the
temporal power to the Pope with such energy that the
perspiration rolled down his fat face in shining rivulets.
I never heard anything like it except in a political convention
or a stock exchange. Accompanied by the Noble
Guard, a body of picked men renowned for their superb
physique and clad in resplendent uniform, the Holy
Father was borne in on an arm-chair, carried by twelve
men, also in uniform. Occasionally he would rise to his
feet with evident effort, leaning on, or rather grasping,
one arm of his chair, and bless the people he was passing,
with two fingers outstretched in the familiar attitude that
we have seen in the pictures. At such times the furious
acclamations, and waving of handkerchiefs, and clapping
of hands, would be redoubled. He passed within arm's
length of us, a little knot of Protestants, silent amid the
uproar. It was a pitiful spectacle. A pallid, feeble, tottering
old man, with slender, shrunken neck, and excessively
sharp and prominent features, nose and chin almost
meeting&mdash;we now understood Zola's description: "The
simious ugliness of his face, the largeness of his nose, the
long slit of his mouth, the hugeness of his ears, the conflicting
jumble of his withered features." But out of this
waxen face peered a pair of brilliant dark eyes, the only
sign of real vitality about him. When he had been carefully
lowered by the chair-bearers, and had taken his
throne on the platform, with his attendants ranged round
him, the spokesman of the pilgrims came forward and
read an address, to which the Pope's amanuensis, standing
by his side, read a brief reply. Then the Pope pronounced
the benediction in a surprisingly clear voice, after
which the pilgrims were introduced individually, not all
of them, but a certain number of representative persons
among them. These all knelt and kissed his hand. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
this ceremony was over the audience closed, and the Pontiff
was borne out as he came in, amid wild applause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Pope's Last
Jubilee in
St. Peter's.</div>

<p>On the third of March, while I was in
Egypt, our party in Rome saw a much
more imposing ceremony than the one I
have just described. Every one has noticed how numerous
the papal jubilees have been during the last quarter
of a century, every year or so seeing the celebration of
some jubilee of the Pope's official life. In twenty-one
years he has had no less than fourteen of them. Their
frequency should not surprise us when we remember that
each of them turns a vast stream of gifts and money
into the papal treasury from every part of the world.
One of my correspondents writes me that for the celebration
of March 3rd both sides of the nave of St. Peter's
were lined with pens or boxes, all free except those near
the high altar, and in the middle of the nave a passage
about fifteen feet wide was railed off for the procession.
"We drove to St. Peter's through a pouring rain about
7:45 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> The building was already packed with people.
It is estimated that there were fifty thousand of us by
eleven o'clock. We walked down the left aisle and took
our position at the base of a pillar, where we could see
the Pope as he entered from the right aisle. There we
waited from eight o'clock till after eleven. He was an
hour late. Finally, we heard the silver trumpets sounding
from the gallery in the dome. His guards preceded him,
and other attendants bearing swords, maces and a cross.
The caps indicating the offices he filled before he became
Pope were carried on cushions by three cardinals. He
was himself carried on the shoulders of twelve men,
dressed in rich red costumes. The Pope sat in his red
and gold chair, richly robed in white satin embroidered
with gold. He wore a crown of the same materials, white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
silk mits, and a large ring. When he entered the nave
he stood and blessed the people, holding up two fingers.
The music was fine. We heard the singing as it came
nearer and nearer, but as soon as the Pope appeared the
people broke into shouts, waving handkerchiefs, and
making so much noise that we could no longer hear the
music. We left after five hours."</p>

<p>Later in the season those members of our party who
remained in Rome while we were travelling through
Egypt and Palestine, had very satisfactory views of King
Edward VII. of England and William II., the Emperor
of Germany, on their visits to Rome. As they had seen
the Prince of Wales in London, and young Prince Edward,
who will also be King of England some day if
he lives, and the other royal children at Marlborough
House, and as they have repeatedly seen King Victor
Emmanuel and Queen Helena, they have had unusual
opportunities for seeing for themselves whether the royalties
are made of common clay. I must say for them
that they are stauncher than ever in their devotion to
the republican ideals of our own country. Their opportunities
for seeing these royalties were better than those
enjoyed by most visitors to Rome, because their rooms
overlooked the palace and grounds of the Queen mother,
Marguerita, and King Edward and the Kaiser, like
other royal visitors to Rome, made it their first business
to call on her. She is still the most beloved woman in
Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Our Quarters
on the Pincian
Hill.</div>

<p>The location of our rooms was advantageous
in many other respects. They were
high up in the southwestern corner of a
tall building on the Pincian Hill, so high that we could
look clear across the city to the Sabine Mountains. As
soon as the sun rose over the eastern hills he looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
cheerily into our windows, and continued his genial companionship
with us till he sank into the Mediterranean
at night. We had selected the rooms with a view to
this particularly, remembering the Italian proverb that
"When the sun goes out of the window, the doctor comes
in at the door." A room on the north side of a building
should never be taken. The Roman winter is short but
sharp. We could see snow on the mountains during
nearly the whole of our stay, which in the case of the
majority of us was five months. Then, too, we were
close to the city wall, and to the gate which led out
into the lovely Borghese Gardens, "whose wooded and
flowery lawns are more beautiful than the finest English
park scenery," where "the stone pines lift their dense
clumps of branches upon a slender length of stem, so
high that they look like green islands in the air, flinging
down a shadow upon the turf so far off that you scarcely
know which tree made it"; where there are "avenues of
cypress, resembling dark flames of huge funeral candles,
which spread dusk and twilight round about them, instead
of cheerful radiance"; and where ancient and majestic
ilex trees "lean over the green turf in ponderous grace....
Never was there a more venerable quietude than
that which sleeps among their sheltering boughs; never
a sweeter sunshine than that which gladdens the gentle
gloom which these leafy patriarchs strive to diffuse over
the swelling and subsiding lawns." Moreover, our quarters
were within so short a walk of the park on the Pincio
(where the band plays every afternoon, and where all
Rome drives round and round the little circle at the top),
and of the terrace of the Villa Medici, that we were
drawn thither day after day to watch the picturesque
groups of models lounging in the wintry sun on the great
flight of steps that lead from the Church of Trinita de'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
Monti down to the Piazza di Spagna, to muse over the
Eternal City spread out below us, with the dome of St.
Peter's, in the distance, standing out against a sky of
gold, and, above all, to watch "the light that broods over
the fallen sun." Nowhere in the world, at least so far
as my observation of it extends, is this wonderful glow
which suffuses all the western sky with crimson, orange
and violet lights after the sun goes down&mdash;nowhere else
is this afterglow at once so rich and so delicate as at
Rome.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sweep of
History Seen
from the
Janiculan.</div>

<p>But it is from the Janiculan Hill, on the
other side of the Tiber, that one gets the
most comprehensive view of the city.
Among other things that take the eye from
that commanding point there are three hills which may
be said to epitomize the history of Rome: on the east
the Palatine, where, as its name intimates, the palaces
of the Cæsar's stood, representing the culmination of the
glory of pagan Rome; on the west, the Vatican, where,
as its name suggests, a prophet ought to dwell, though
I fear he does not, and where St. Peter's, with its "insolent
opulence of marble" and its colossal apotheosis of
the popedom, represents the culmination of the glory of
papal Rome; and, immediately in front, in the centre of
the city, the Quirinal, where Victor Emmanuel's royal
house stands, representing the new government of free
and united Italy. From his windows in the Quirinal
Palace, the King can look across the intervening city to
the windows of that other palace where the relentless foe
of his government lives, that vast, luxurious "prison" of
the Vatican, with its eleven thousand rooms, the largest
palace in the world, with its museums and libraries filled
with priceless treasures, and with its extensive gardens
and grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>Zola has pointed out how persistent, through all these
three periods of Rome's history, has been that passion
for cyclopean building, the "blossoming of that ancient
sap, peculiar to the soil of Rome, which in all ages has
thrown up preposterous edifices, of exaggerated hugeness
and dazzling and ruinous luxury." First, the pagan emperors
set the pace, and of their work we may take the
Colosseum and the Baths of Caracalla as specimens.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Colosseum
and the Baths
of Caracalla.</div>

<p>"The Colosseum. Ah! that colossus, only
one-half or so of which has been destroyed
by time as with the stroke of a mighty
scythe, it rises in its enormity and majesty like a stone
lacework, with hundreds of empty bays agape against
the blue of heaven! There is a world of halls, stairs,
landings and passages, a world where one loses one's
self amid the death-like silence and solitude. The furrowed
tiers of seats, eaten into by the atmosphere, are
like shapeless steps leading down into some old extinct
crater, some natural circus excavated by the force of the
elements in indestructible rock. The hot suns of eighteen
hundred years have baked and scorched this ruin, which
has reverted to a state of nature, bare and golden-brown
like a mountain side, since it has been stripped of its
vegetation, the flora which once made it like a virgin
forest. And what an evocation when the mind sets flesh
and blood and life again on all that dead osseous framework,
fills the circus with the ninety thousand spectators
which it could hold, marshals the games and the combats
of the arena, gathers a whole civilization together, from
the emperor and the dignitaries to the surging plebeian
sea, all aglow with the agitation and brilliancy of an
impassioned people, assembled under the ruddy reflection
of the giant purple <i>velum</i>. And then, yet further on the
horizon, were other cyclopean ruins, the Baths of Caracalla,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
standing there like relics of a race of giants long
since vanished from the world: halls extravagantly and
inexplicably spacious and lofty; vestibules large enough
for an entire population; a <i>frigidarium</i>, where five hundred
people could swim together; a <i>tepidarium</i> and a
<i>calidarium</i> on the same proportions, born of a wild craving
for the huge; and then the terrific massiveness of
the structures, the thickness of the piles of brick-work,
such as no feudal castle ever knew; and, in addition, the
general immensity which makes passing visitors look like
lost ants; one wonders for what men, for what multitudes,
this monstrous edifice was reared. To-day you
would say a mass of rocks in the rough thrown from
some height for building the abode of Titans."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Papal
Passion for
Terrestrial
Immortality.</div>

<p>Then the Popes, when they came to power,
followed this pagan example, moved by the
same spirit of conquest, the same human
vanity, the same passionate desire to set
their names on imperishable walls, and, after dominating
the world, to leave behind them indestructible traces,
tangible proofs of their passing glory, eternal edifices of
bronze and marble, to attest that glory till the end of
time. "Among the illustrious popes there has not been
one that did not seek to build, did not revert to the traditions
of the Cæsars, eternizing their reigns in stone
and raising temples for resting-places, so as to rank
among the gods. Ever the same passion for terrestrial
immortality has burst forth: it has been a battle as to
who should leave the highest, most substantial, most gorgeous
monument; and so acute has been the disease that
those who, for lack of means and opportunity, have been
unable to build, and have been forced to content themselves
with repairing, have, nevertheless, desired to bequeath
the memory of their modest achievements to subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
generations by commemorative marble slabs engraved
with pompous inscriptions. These slabs are to
be seen on every side; not a wall has ever been strengthened
but some pope has stamped it with his arms, not a
ruin has been restored, not a palace repaired, not a fountain
cleaned, but the reigning pope has signed the work
with his Roman and pagan title of 'Pontifex Maximus.'
<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
It is a haunting passion, a form of involuntary debauchery,
the fated florescence of that compost of ruins,
that dust of edifices whence new edifices are ever arising.
And given the perversion with which the old Roman soil
almost immediately tarnished the doctrines of Jesus, that
resolute passion for domination, and that desire for terrestrial
glory which wrought the triumph of Catholicism
in scorn of the humble and pure, the fraternal and simple
ones of the primitive church, one may well ask whether
Rome has ever been Christian at all."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Building
Boom under
the New
Government.</div>

<p>And, finally, the new government of Victor
Emmanuel, for a time at least, was caught
in the same current, infected with the same
mania for building that seems to exhale
from the very soil of the Eternal City. As the popes
had not become masters of Rome without feeling impelled
to rebuild it in their passion to rule over the world,
so young Italy, "yielding to the hereditary madness of
universal domination, had in its turn sought to make the
city larger than any other, erecting whole districts for
people who never came." But, fortunately for Italy, the
old idea was not unmixed with newer and better ones.
Their first delirious outburst of huge building operations
has been explained as "a legitimate explosion of the delight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
and the hopes of a young nation anxious to show
its power. The question was to make Rome a modern
capital worthy of a great kingdom, and before aught else
there were sanitary requirements to be dealt with; the
city needed to be cleansed of all the filth which disgraced
it. One cannot nowadays imagine in what abominable
putrescence the City of the Popes, the <i>Roma sporca</i> which
artists regret, was then steeped: the vast majority of the
houses lacked even the most primitive arrangements, the
public thoroughfares were used for all purposes, noble
ruins served as store-places for sewage, the princely
palaces were surrounded by filth, and the streets were
perfect manure beds, which fostered frequent epidemics.
Thus, vast municipal works were absolutely necessary;
the question was one of health and life itself. And in
much the same way it was only right to think of building
houses for the new comers who would assuredly flock
into the city. There had been a precedent at Berlin,
whose population, after the establishment of the German
Empire, had suddenly increased by some hundreds of
thousands. In the same way the population of Rome
would certainly be doubled, tripled, quadrupled, for, as
the new centre of national life, the city would necessarily
attract all the <i>vis viva</i> of the provinces. And at this
thought pride stepped in; the fallen government of the
Vatican must be shown what Italy was capable of achieving,
what splendor she would bestow on the new and
third Rome, which, by the magnificence of its thoroughfares
and the multitude of its people, would far excel
either the imperial or the papal city." We need not follow
the melancholy story of this delusion. The boom had a
disastrous collapse, and the city was left full of vast, pretentious,
flimsy, deserted palaces. The best thing about
them is that they are perishable. The lesson, happily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
was not lost on the men of the new order in Italy, and
they seem at last to have extricated themselves from the
toils of that miasmatic megalo-mania. The government
is sane, sound, conservative, proceeding with care and
deliberation in its upbuilding of the country, understanding
the meaning of the proverb that "Rome was not built
in a day," and it has already given the country more
security and prosperity than it has enjoyed for many,
many centuries. If it can continue to maintain itself
against the priests, there is undoubtedly a bright future
before Italy.</p>

<p>But can it maintain itself against the priests? I think
so. Yet a man would be blind indeed who could not
see their number, power and activity. Rome swarms
with them. Speaking of the incredible number of cassocks
that one encounters in the streets, Zola says: "Ah!
that ebb and flow; that ceaseless tide of black gowns
and frocks of every hue! With their processions of students
ever walking abroad, the seminaries of the different
nations would alone suffice to drape and decorate the
streets, for there are the French and the English all in
black, the South Americans in black with blue sashes,
the North Americans in black with red sashes, the Poles
in black with green sashes, the Greeks in blue, the Germans
in red, the Scots in violet, the Romans in black or
violet or purple, the Bohemians with chocolate sashes,
the Irish with red lappets, the Spaniards with blue cords,
to say nothing of all the others with broidery and bindings
and buttons in a hundred different styles. And, in
addition, there are the confraternities, the penitents,
white, black, blue and gray, with sleeveless frocks and
capes of different hue, gray, blue, black or white. And
thus, even nowadays, papal Rome at times seems to resuscitate,
and one can realize how tenaciously and vigorously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
she struggles on in order that she may not disappear in
the cosmopolitan Rome of the new era." Yes, Italy will
escape from the clutches of the papacy, but she will have
to work. There must be no relaxation of vigilance or
energy on her part&mdash;or on ours. For this multitude of
young priests from every part of the world spells menace
for other lands besides Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Cappuccini
Cemetery.</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Only</span> three or four blocks from our hotel stands the
Church of the Cappuccini, which contains one of
the most gruesome sights in Rome, the celebrated cemetery
of the Cappuccini monks, the soil of which was
brought from Jerusalem. All Roman Catholic
cemeteries have a peculiarly melancholy
aspect. They have none of that gentle beauty which is
so characteristic of our cemeteries, where the grass grows
green under the open sky or great trees cast their peaceful
shade over "God's acre." But this is the most weird and
ghastly of them all. There are four recesses or chapels
underneath the church, the pillars and pilasters of which
are made of thigh-bones and skulls, the architectural
ornaments being represented by the joints of the spine,
and the more delicate tracery by the smaller bones of
the human frame. "The summits of the arches are
adorned with entire skeletons, looking as if they were
wrought most skillfully in bas-relief. There is no possibility
of describing how ugly and grotesque is the effect....
On some of the skulls there are inscriptions,
purporting that such a monk, who formerly made use
of that particular head-piece, died on such a day and
year; but vastly the greater number are piled up undistinguishably
into the architectural design.... In the
side walls of the vaults are niches where skeleton monks
sit or stand, clad in the brown habits that they wore in
life.... Yet let us give the cemetery the praise that
it deserves. There is no disagreeable scent, such as might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
have been expected from the decay of so many holy
persons, in whatever odor of sanctity they may have
taken their departure. The same number of living monks
would not smell half so unexceptionably." So Hawthorne
says, and I have spared my readers the most disagreeable
parts of his description.</p>

<p>The allusion in his last sentence is one which is justified
by the olfactory organs of every visitor to Rome.
The vices which were encouraged in the magnificent baths
of the emperors, and which have given the word <i>bagnio</i>
an evil signification the world over, "found their reaction
in the impression of the early Christians that uncleanliness
was a virtue, an impression which is retained by
several of the monastic orders to the present day." We
sometimes weary of the superabundant advertisements
of the different kinds of soap in the advertising pages
of our monthly magazines. But what a wholesome sign
it is! And what a difference it marks between us and
the average Italian! And what a field for their business
would be opened to Mr. Pears and the rest if only the
monks would adopt the view that "cleanliness is next to
godliness," and that, therefore, soap might be regarded
as a sort of means of grace!</p>

<div class="sidenote">Some Differences
between
America
and Italy.</div>

<p>Mark Twain once described what he would
say, if he were a native of Italy, and had
been on a visit to the United States, and
had come back to the Campagna for the
purpose of telling his Italian countrymen what he had
seen in America: "One hardly ever sees a minister of
the gospel going around there in his bare feet, with a
basket, begging for subsistence. In that country the
preachers are not like our mendicant orders of friars&mdash;they
have two or three suits of clothing, <i>and they wash
sometimes</i>."... "I saw common men and common
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
women who could read; I even saw small children of
common country people reading from books; if I dared
think you would believe it, I would say they could write,
also.... I saw real glass windows in the houses of
even the commonest people. Some of the houses are not
of stone, nor yet of bricks; I solemnly swear they are
made of wood. Houses there will take fire and burn,
sometimes&mdash;actually burn entirely down, and not leave
a single vestige behind. I could state that for a truth
upon my death-bed. And, as a proof that the circumstance
is not rare, I aver that they have a thing which
they call a fire-engine, which vomits forth great streams
of water, and is kept always in readiness, by night and
by day, to rush to houses that are burning. You would
think one engine would be sufficient, but some great cities
have a hundred; they keep men hired, and pay them
by the month to do nothing but put out fires.
<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>... In
that singular country if a rich man dies a sinner, he is
damned; he cannot buy salvation with money for masses.
There is really not much use in being rich there. Not
much use as far as the other world is concerned, but
much, very much, use as concerns this; because there,
if a man be rich, he is very greatly honored, and can become
a legislator, a governor, a general, a senator, no
matter how ignorant an ass he is&mdash;just as in our beloved
Italy the nobles hold all the great places, even though
sometimes they are born noble idiots. There, if a man
be rich, they give him costly presents, they ask him to
feasts, they invite him to drink complicated beverages;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
but if he be poor and in debt, they require him to do that
which they term to 'settle.'... In that country you
might fall from a third-story window three several times
and not mash either a soldier or a priest.... Jews
there are treated just like human beings, instead of dogs....
They never have had to run races naked through
the public streets against jackasses to please the people
in carnival time; there they never have been driven by
the soldiers into a church every Sunday for hundreds
of years to hear themselves and their religion especially
and particularly cursed."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a>

<div class="sidenote">The Playful
Inquisition.</div>

<p>While I have Mark Twain in hand, I will
make two more quotations from him, and
then dismiss him for good. Looking from the dome of
St. Peter's upon the building which was once the Inquisition,
he says: "How times are changed, between the
older ages and the new! Some seventeen or eighteen
centuries ago, the ignorant men of Rome were wont to
put Christians in the arena of the Coliseum yonder, and
turn the wild beasts in upon them for a show. It was
for a lesson as well. It was to teach the people to abhor
and fear the new doctrine the followers of Christ were
teaching. The beasts tore the victims limb from limb,
and made poor mangled corpses of them in the twinkling
of an eye. But when the Christians came into power,
when the holy Mother Church became mistress of the
barbarians, she taught them the error of their ways by
no such means. No, she put them in this pleasant Inquisition,
and pointed to the blessed Redeemer, who was
so gentle and so merciful toward all men, and they urged
the barbarians to love him; and they did all they could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
to persuade them to love and honor him&mdash;first by twisting
their thumbs out of joint with a screw; then by
nipping their flesh with pincers&mdash;red-hot ones, because
they are the most comfortable in cold weather; then by
skinning them alive a little, and finally by roasting them
in public. They always convinced those barbarians. The
true religion, properly administered, as the good Mother
Church used to administer it, is very, very soothing. It
is wonderfully persuasive, also. There is a great difference
between feeding parties to wild beasts and stirring
up their finer feelings in an Inquisition. One is the
system of degraded barbarians, the other of enlightened,
civilized people. It is a great pity the playful Inquisition
is no more."</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Relative
Rank of the
Deities
Worshipped
in Rome.</div>

<p>Speaking of a mosaic group at the side of
the Scala Santa which represents the Saviour,
St. Peter, Pope Leo, St. Silvester,
Constantine and Charlemagne, he says:
"Peter is giving the <i>pallium</i> to the Pope,
and a standard to Charlemagne. The Saviour is giving
the keys to St. Silvester, and a standard to Constantine.
No prayer is offered to the Saviour, who seems to be of
little importance anywhere in Rome; but an inscription
below says, '<i>Blessed Peter, give life to Pope Leo and
victory to King Charles</i>.' It does not say, '<i>Intercede for
us</i>, through the Saviour, with the Father, for this boon,'
but 'Blessed Peter, <i>give it</i> us.'</p>

<p>"In all seriousness&mdash;without meaning to be frivolous,
without meaning to be irreverent, and, more than all,
without meaning to be blasphemous&mdash;I state, as my simple
deduction from the things I have seen and the things I
have heard, that the Holy Personages rank thus in Rome:</p>

<p>"<i>First.</i> 'The Mother of God'&mdash;otherwise the Virgin
Mary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Second.</i> The Deity.</p>

<p>"<i>Third.</i> Peter.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourth.</i> Some twelve or fifteen canonized popes and
martyrs.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifth.</i> Jesus Christ the Saviour (but always an infant
in arms).</p>

<p>"I may be wrong in this&mdash;my judgment errs often,
just as is the case with other men's&mdash;but it <i>is</i> my judgment,
be it good or bad.</p>

<p>"Just here I will mention something that seems curious
to me. There are no 'Christ's Churches' in Rome,
and no 'Churches of the Holy Ghost,' that I can discover.
There are some four hundred churches, but about a fourth
of them seem to be named for the Madonna and St. Peter.
There are so many named for Mary that they have to
be distinguished by all sorts of affixes, if I understand
the matter rightly. Then we have churches of St. Louis,
St. Augustine, St. Agnes, St. Calixtus, St. Lorenzo in
Lucina, St. Lorenzo in Damaso, St. Cecilia, St. Athanasius,
St. Philip Neri, St. Catherine, St. Dominico, and a
multitude of lesser saints whose names are not familiar
in the world&mdash;and away down, clear out of the list of
the churches, comes a couple of hospitals; one of them
is named for the Saviour and the other for the Holy
Ghost!"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Fee of the
Visitor more
Important
than the
Soul of the
Worshipper.</div>

<p>But we have allowed this clean, shrewd,
racy American with his biting satire and
his outspoken common sense, to lead us far
away from our subject. Let us come back
to the Church of the Cappuccini. For, besides
its horrible cemetery, it contains another
object of great interest, though of a very different
character, viz., Guido's great picture of the Archangel
Michael trampling upon the devil. The devil's face is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
said to be a portrait of Pope Innocent X., against whom
the painter had a spite. It is not for the purpose of describing
the picture that I refer to it, for I am not competent
to do that, but for the purpose of quoting the
animadversions of another American writer upon the custom
of concealing this picture and others of special
interest in Romish churches with closely drawn curtains,
requiring the presence of an attendant to unveil them
and the bestowment of a fee by the visitor. "The churchmen
of Italy make no scruple of sacrificing the very purpose
for which a work of sacred art has been created, that
of opening the way for religious sentiment through the
quick medium of sight, by bringing angels, saints and
martyrs down visibly upon earth&mdash;of sacrificing this
high purpose, and, for aught they know, the welfare of
many souls along with it, to the hope of a paltry fee.
Every work by an artist of celebrity is hidden behind a
veil, and seldom revealed, except to Protestants, who
scorn it as an object of devotion, and value it only for its
artistic merit."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sensuality

<p>The same author (Hawthorne), speaking
of the terrible lack of variety in the subjects
of the great Italian masters, says a quarter
part, probably, of any large collection of
pictures consists of Virgins and infant Christs....
Half of the other pictures are Magdalens, Flights into
Egypt, Crucifixions, etc. "The remainder of the gallery
comprises mythological subjects, such as nude Venuses,
Ledas, Graces, and, in short, a general apotheosis of
nudity.... These impure pictures are from the same
illustrious and impious hands that adventured to call
before us the august forms of apostles and saints, the
Blessed Mother of the Redeemer, and her Son, at his
death, and in his glory, and even the awfulness of him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
to whom the martyrs, dead a thousand years ago, have
not dared to raise their eyes. They seem to take up one
task or the other&mdash;the disrobed woman whom they call
Venus, or the type of highest and tenderest womanhood
in the mother of the Saviour&mdash;with equal readiness, but
to achieve the former with far more satisfactory success.
If an artist sometimes produced a picture of the Virgin
possessing warmth enough to excite devotional feelings,
it was probably the object of his earthly love, to whom he
thus paid the stupendous and fearful homage of setting
up her portrait to be worshipped, not figuratively as a
mortal, but by religious souls in their earnest aspirations
towards divinity. And who can trust the religious sentiment
of Raphael, or receive any of his Virgins as heaven-descended
likenesses, after seeing, for example, the "Fornarina"
of the Barberini Palace, and feeling how sensual
the artist must have been to paint such a brazen trollop
of his own accord, and lovingly? Would the Blessed
Mary reveal herself to his spiritual vision, and favor him
with sittings alternately with that type of glowing earthliness,
the Fornarina?"</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Kind of
Character
Produced.</div>

<p>True, Hawthorne proceeds at once to
weaken the force of this criticism somewhat
by referring to the throng of spiritual faces,
innocent cherubs, serene angels, pure-eyed madonnas,
and "that divinest countenance in the Transfiguration"&mdash;all
of which we owe to Raphael's marvellous brush. But
the criticism above quoted is sound. And that Hawthorne
himself saw how little such "sacred art" had availed to
lift the representatives of this kind of worship out of
gross sensualism, let the following passage witness:
"Here was a priesthood, pampered, sensual, with red and
bloated cheeks, and carnal eyes. With apparently a
grosser development of animal life than most men, they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
were placed in an unnatural relation with woman, and
thereby lost the healthy, human conscience that pertains
to other human beings, who own the sweet household
ties connecting them with wife and daughter. And here
was an indolent nobility, with no high aims or opportunities,
but cultivating a vicious way of life, as if it
were an art, and the only one which they cared to learn.
Here was a population, high and low, that had no genuine
belief in virtue; and if they recognized any act as criminal,
they might throw off all care, remorse and memory
of it, by kneeling a little while at the confessional, and
rising unburdened, active, elastic and incited by fresh
appetite for the next ensuing sin."</p>

<p>Of course all the priests are not such as above described,
as Eugene Sue has endeavored to show in the
character of Gabriel in <i>The Wandering Jew</i>, and Victor
Hugo in the character of the good bishop in <i>Les Miserables</i>,
and Marie Corelli in the character of the good Cardinal
Bonpre in <i>The Master Christian</i>. Hawthorne simply
describes the prevailing type. Let it be observed,
too, that he is speaking of the priests in Italy, not of those
in America, among whom we are glad to believe there
is a much larger proportion of good men. Moreover, it
should not be forgotten that the present Premier of Italy
has himself stated publicly, in a passage which I have
quoted in Chapter XXIX., that there has been some improvement,
at least in the outward conduct of the clergy,
since the overthrow of the papal government, and that the
immorality of the priests and cardinals is not so shamelessly
flaunted in Rome as it used to be under the popes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Other Type.</div>

<p>On the 20th of September, 1870, the Italian
army entered Rome, after a slight resistance.
This event, which marked the downfall of the
temporal power of the papacy, the unification of Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
and the establishment of religious liberty under the enlightened
and progressive government of Victor Emmanuel,
is properly commemorated in the name of a handsome
street, Via Venti Settembre, which extends from
the Porta Pia, where the army entered, to the Quirinal
Palace, where the King resides. Appropriately placed on
a street which thus commemorates the establishment of
civil and religious freedom in Italy, are several of the
Protestant churches, which for the last thirty years have
caused a pure river of water of life to flow once more
through Rome as in the days when the great Apostle
of the Gentiles preached there the kingdom of God, and
taught the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with
all boldness, none forbidding him.</p>

<p>At No. 7 on this high and pleasant street we find a
tall, clean, handsome building, standing well back from
the street, with a spacious, green yard in front, the whole
occupying a portion of what were once the gardens of
the Barberini Palace. A neat notice-board on the high
iron picket fence informs us that this attractive building
is the Presbyterian Church, and that the pastor is the
Rev. J. Gordon Gray, D. D.</p>

<div class="sidenote">An Apostolic

<p>When you enter the church on Sunday
morning, a few minutes before eleven
o'clock, you find it filled with a congregation
of exceptionally intelligent people, mostly English-speaking
residents in Rome and English-speaking visitors from
every part of the world, including many Christians of
other denominations besides our own&mdash;for it does not
take visitors in Rome long to find out how strong and
wholesome is the spiritual nourishment here furnished,
how broad-minded and large-hearted the minister is, and
how surely he declares the whole counsel of God, without
ever a syllable that can offend any of those who love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. If you return in the
afternoon, as you will do if you are wise, and as everybody
does, in fact, after hearing him once, you will find
the house full again, and, while you will see no splendid
pageant, no rows of bishops and archbishops in purple
and lace and furs, no robing and disrobing, no intoned
service in Latin, no choral responses from high and gilded
choir loft, no clouds of incense filling the air&mdash;you will
hear the old sweet gospel in all its pristine purity&mdash;you
will see the great apostle and his friends before you, instinct
with life and love and zeal, as the minister lectures,
with astonishing fullness and accuracy of information
and sympathetic understanding, on Roman Sites which
can be identified with St. Paul's Sojourn Here, The Saints
of Cæsar's Household in the light of the Columbaria,
The Site and probable incidents of Paul's Roman Trial,
The First Martyrdoms and the probable Site of Nero's
Circus, Paul's Two Years in his Hired House, Paul's
Travels and Labors between his First and Second Roman
Imprisonments, The Closing Years of Paul's Ministry,
The Jews in Rome in Paul's Time&mdash;and you will hear
things that make for the peace of your soul and for your
upbuilding on your most holy faith as he expounds The
Chief Elements of Paul's Teaching; Christ in Early
Christian Art as found in the Roman Catacombs; The
State after Death, Prayers to the Dead, and Prayers for
the Dead, in the light of the testimony of the Roman
Catacombs; The Place and Efficacy of the Sacraments in
the light of the testimony of the Roman Catacombs; and
The Ministry in the Early Church of the Catacombs.</p>

<p>Surely never was Christian workman better
adapted to his work than Dr. Gray. The
sturdy frame, the massive head, the clear eye, the kindly
voice, the genial manner, the transparent sincerity, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the ready sympathy of the man, invite one's confidence
from the first, and the longer you know him the more you
value him for his rare combination of strength and tenderness,
and for his wisdom, piety and learning. We had
the good fortune to hear his sermon on the eighteenth
anniversary of the formation of his pastorate in Rome,
in which he reviewed the history of his church during
those eighteen years, and the years immediately preceding,
and the growth of Protestantism in Rome since the downfall
of the papacy&mdash;and a deeply interesting discourse
it was. It lifted one's hopes for the future of Italy.
Undoubtedly the day is breaking over the darkness which
has so long lain like a pall over this lovely land.</p>

<p>A good man is known by his prayers. There is a
fullness, propriety and fervor about Dr. Gray's public
prayers that are seldom equalled. The homesick stranger,
with the wide ocean between him and his native land&mdash;the
professional man wavering in health and doubtful
as to the future&mdash;the stricken widow, who has lost her
husband by the sudden stroke of death&mdash;as well as those
who bear the usual burdens of the human heart, find
themselves strangely comforted and cheered, strangely
relieved of their toils and cares and anxieties and fears,
strangely upborne and strengthened, as this man of God
pours from a sympathetic heart the needs of his people
into the ear of him who careth for us. Among the usual
petitions on Sunday morning there is invariably one for
the King of England and the royal family, the President
of the United States, and the King and Queen of Italy.
We had two reminders on the 22nd of February that it
was Washington's birthday: one was the flags hanging
out at the American Embassy, and the other was Dr.
Gray's prayer of thanksgiving for the character and services
of Washington. He never forgets anything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet his activities are multifarious. His resourcefulness,
adequacy and strength have long since made him
the real dean of the fine force of Protestant ministers in
Rome. His advice is sought by them, and by all manner
of visitors to Rome, on all manner of subjects. He is
deeply interested in the matter of excavating the house
of Priscilla and Aquila, the Apostle Paul's friends, on the
Aventine, and hopes to raise the necessary funds and have
that done&mdash;a valuable service to archæological and biblical
learning. He ought by all means to be allowed to
find time to publish a volume on The Apostle Paul in
Rome. Dr. Gray is another of the many good gifts of
Scotland to the world, and, like Dr. Alexander Whyte,
of Edinburgh, and other eminent Scotchmen, is an Aberdeen
man. They are some of the Aberdonians who almost
tempt us at times to agree with the Aberdeen man of
whom our good Scotch physician in Rome told me the
other day, who said, "Tak' awa' Aberdeen and sax miles
around it, and what would you have left?"</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Inexhaustibleness of Rome.</span></p>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Rome</span> is easily the most interesting city in the world.
The subject is simply inexhaustible. Ampere said
that by diligence one could obtain a superficial knowledge
of it in ten years. Just what terms should be used to
characterize the seventy pages or so that I have written,
from the basis of the desultory reading and observation
of only a few months, I must leave to the decision of the
reader. "Presumptuous sciolism," perhaps. And, yet,
though I have filled these seventy pages with what I
regarded as pertinent descriptions, salient facts and suggestive
quotations from the best authorities, all subjected
to as much compression as was consistent with a fair
statement of the particular points which I wished to make,
I have restricted myself almost exclusively to one phase
of the subject, viz., Ecclesiastical Rome, and have had
almost nothing to say of Classical Rome and Artistic
Rome.</p>

<p>Even when confining myself to this one line, I have
found no opportunity to give you any description of the
Appian Way, over the paving-stones of which the Apostle
Paul entered Rome in 56 A. D. (Acts xxviii. 14-16);
or of the Pyramid of Cestius, still standing beside the
road, just outside the gate which now bears the apostle's
name&mdash;a sepulchral monument upon which his eyes must
have rested for a moment as he passed out to his own
execution&mdash;"Among the works of man, that pyramid is
the only surviving witness of the martyrdom of St. Paul";
or of the Catacombs, those vast labyrinths of subterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
galleries, the aggregate length of which is estimated at
nearly six hundred miles, so that if placed end to end
they would extend the whole length of Italy&mdash;where the
bodies of thousands of the early Christians were laid in
full hope of the resurrection; or of the bronze statue of
St. Peter in the great cathedral, the extended foot of
which has been largely worn away by the kisses of Roman
Catholic devotees&mdash;the figure which, on the occasion of
Pope Leo's Jubilee, our party saw dressed up in a mitre
and pontifical robes; or of Houdon's marvellous statue
of St. Bruno in the Church of St. Maria degli Angeli,
of which Clement XIV., the Pope who is supposed to
have died of poison administered by the Jesuits, in 1774,
used to say, "He would speak, if the rule of his order
did not forbid it"; or of the statue of that other Bruno
who now stands in the Campo de' Fiori, on the spot
where he was burnt as a heretic in 1600 for his advocacy
of the Copernican system.</p>

<p>I have been able to say nothing of the remains of
Classical Rome, such as the palaces of the Cæsars, the
Arch of Titus&mdash;with its bas-reliefs of the golden candle-stick
and other treasures from the Temple at Jerusalem,
which were borne among the spoils of that Emperor's
triumph&mdash;the monuments of the Forum, the Column of
Trajan, the tomb of Hadrian, the much lauded equestrian
statue of Marcus Aurelius on the Capitoline Hill, the
immensely impressive Pantheon, and the majestic statue
of Pompey, at the foot of which Julius Cæsar was assassinated.</p>

<p>I have not been able even to mention such masterpieces
of sculpture as the Dancing Faun, the Dying Gaul&mdash;"butchered
to make a Roman holiday"&mdash;the Laocoon,
the Apollo Belvedere, the Young Augustus, and scores
of others, or such paintings as Guido's "Aurora," Michelangelo's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
"Last Judgment," and the scarcely less wonderful
creations of Botticelli, Titian and Domenichino.</p>

<p>I have had to pass unnoticed such tempting details as
the Tarpeian Rock, the site of the bridge which Horatius
kept in the brave days of old, the walls of the Paedagogium
under the Palatine cliff, where a school boy had
drawn, for the encouragement of his successors, a sketch
of an ass turning a corn-mill, with the superscription in
Latin, "Work, little donkey, as I have worked, and it
will profit thee"; the famous Keyhole View of St. Peter's
from the Aventine, and many others, for which I must
refer you to other books.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Best Books
about Rome.</div>

<p>Besides the books on Rome, such as Hare's
<i>Walks</i>, and Hawthorne's <i>Marble Faun</i>, to
which I have tried to introduce my readers by appetizing
quotations from time to time in former letters, I must
mention also Dennie's <i>Pagan Rome</i>, Story's <i>Roba di
Roma</i>, Mrs. Ward's <i>Eleanor</i> (which contains the best
descriptions of the wonderful scenery around Lake
Nemi), and the standard works of Professor Lanciani.
These are much better for home reading, and even for
reading on the spot, than the guide books. In a sumptuously
bound and profusely illustrated copy of Lanciani's
<i>New Tales of Old Rome</i>, which was presented to me
by a friend last Christmas, I find a criticism of the well-known
passage in which Lord Mahon refers to the fact
that the last of the Stuarts, the Old Pretender, his wife,
and his two sons, are buried in St. Peter's, and where,
Lord Mahon says, "a stately monument from the chisel
of Canova has since risen to the memory of James III.,
Charles III., and Henry IX., kings of England, names
which an Englishman can scarcely read without a smile
or a sigh." Lanciani says, "Lord Mahon could have
saved both his smiles and his sighs if he had simply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
read with care the epitaph engraved on the monument,
which says: 'To James III., son of James II., King of
Great Britain, to Charles Edward, and Henry, Dean of
the Sacred College, Sons of James III., the last of the
Royal House of Stuart.'" This is the only statement,
so far as I have observed, in Professor Lanciani's writings
which is not scrupulously fair. That the criticism
is not perfectly fair is clear from the very inscription
which he cites, where the Old Pretender is twice called
James III.; from the inscription on the tomb of his wife,
close at hand, where she is called "Queen of Great Britain,
France and Ireland"; from the fact that the canopy under
which the body of the Old Pretender lay in state at Rome
for five days, crowned, sceptred, and in royal robes, was
inscribed, "Jacobus, Magnæ Britanniæ Rex, Anno
MDCCLXVI."; and from the fact, stated by Lanciani
himself in the same volume, that when Charles Edward,
the Young Pretender, died, Cardinal York, his brother,
proclaimed himself the legitimate sovereign of Great
Britain and Ireland, under the name of Henry IX. Lord
Mahon was substantially correct.</p>

<p>St. Peter's is a peculiarly appropriate place of sepulture
for the line of tyrannical kings who tried so hard
to fasten the yoke of Romanism upon Great Britain.
They went to their own place. England and Scotland
will do well to remember that the same forces which the
Stuarts represented, and which endangered their liberties
then, still constitute the gravest menace to the true freedom
of their island empire.</p>

<p>One other book I must mention before finishing what
I have to say about the literature of this vast subject:
the volume entitled <i>Ave Roma Immortalis</i>, by Francis
Marion Crawford, son of the sculptor to whom we are
indebted for the superb equestrian statue of Washington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
at Richmond, with its circle of illustrious Virginians in
bronze. Let no one be deterred by the Latin title. The
book itself is written in the most delightful English. It
is not to be commended without qualification, for this
prolific author who bears the name of the immortal
Huguenot partisan of South Carolina, and ought by
every consideration, so far as we know, to be a sturdy
Protestant, has suffered somewhat in his religious faith
by his Italian birth and rearing. But his book is full
of good things culled from wide and discriminating reading,
the feature that is really of most value in a book
of travel.</p>

<p>But I must not forget that, while there is no limit to
such a subject as Rome, there is a limit to the patience
of my readers. So we will now take leave of Rome
abruptly, and pass at once to Naples and its environs,
where we spent the concluding days of our sojourn in
Italy.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Naples</span> is the largest, dirtiest and most beautiful
city in Italy. From the balconies of our hotel,
which stands high on the thickly-built hillside, we have
a matchless view&mdash;the cream-colored city at our feet,
with its red roofs and blue domes, rising from the water's
edge and climbing the embayed mountain like half of
a vast amphitheatre; the volcano of Vesuvius beyond,
lifting its white plume of warning smoke by day, and
sometimes glaring red at night; the brown ruins of overwhelmed
but disentombed Pompeii a little to the right;
then the cliffs of Sorrento; and, stretching between us
and them, the bay itself, with its incomparable crescent

  <div class="caption">PANORAMA OF NAPLES.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Street Scenes
in Naples.</div>

<p>The contrast between the heavenly scenery of this bay
and that awful volcano, which stands over it like an ever-present
threat of destruction, reminds one of the cherubim
which stood at the gate of Eden to guarantee the restoration
of redeemed and glorified humanity to communion
with God, along with the self-revolving sword which symbolized
the certainty and terribleness of divine vengeance
upon sin. But neither by the promises of his grace nor
by the threat of his vengeance do these people seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
be restrained from sin. Many of them are sunk in vice.
The contrast between splendor and squalor,
superfluous wealth and abject poverty,
which characterizes all large cities, is sharper, if possible,
here than anywhere else. But it is the latter, the picturesque
misery of Naples, that makes most impression
upon the visitor. Some of the narrow streets, often not
more than ten or twenty feet wide, are indescribably
filthy, and they swarm with bareheaded, untidy women
and half-naked children, yelling hucksters and pertinacious
beggars, dirty monks and gowned priests. All
this, and more which cannot here be set down, in one of
the loveliest places on this beautiful earth.</p>

<p>An observant and witty friend of mine says: "The
people live outdoors, and for the best of reason&mdash;they
would die indoors.... Into most of the living rooms
on their narrowest streets the sun never shines....
At the best, the ordinary buildings feel sepulchral, and
an overcoat is to be worn here in the house, and not on
the streets! Lining the sides of many, if not most of the
streets, are shops or booths. They are, as far as one
can see, single rooms, furnished about the door with
vegetables, or meats, or maccaroni, or wine bottles, or
charcoal, or bread, the rest of the room filled with beds
and tables and dressers, with dishes and food, and shrines
and highly-colored chromos of the saints and apostles.
The children are washed and dressed in the doorways,
and their heads constantly watched and investigated,
much after the friendly fashion of monkeys. By the way,
peddlers are forever thrusting small boxes of combs into
our faces, insisting upon our buying. We have not purchased
any yet&mdash;but who can tell? The people do much
of their cooking in small braziers outside the doors, on
the sidewalk, burning charcoal and fanning the fires with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
hats or aprons. They have no hesitancy about eating
out of the same dish and in the public eye. Cows and
goats are driven along the street and milked at the doors
into glasses or bottles, which seems a fair guarantee for
the milk being fresh. The calves and kids come to town,
too, and take in the ways of the city, along with what
they get of their mothers' milk. Women wash clothes
at the public fountains, some bringing wash-boards or
flat stones, some treading the clothes in tubs with their
feet. From windows and balconies, on lines stretched
along the streets and on cane poles that almost touch the
opposite houses, the wet things drip and dry. Squads
of soldiers in various uniforms pass and repass at all times
of day; old women knit and rest in the doorways; vegetable
and fish venders proclaim their wares in high, hard
voices. At their cries baskets are let down from upper
windows, and the sharpest bargains in the shrillest accents
are driven in midair. If the goods are not satisfactory,
down go the baskets to the sidewalk."</p>

<p>Of course we visited the aquarium, said to be the
finest in the world, and the museum, with its two thousand
mural paintings brought from Pompeii, and its
collection of ancient bronzes&mdash;also the finest in the
world.</p>

<p>But the things that interested us most were not in
Naples, but around it&mdash;such as Puteoli, where, many
centuries ago, on a balmy spring day like this, when the
south wind was blowing softly over the sea, the Apostle
Paul landed, with Luke and Aristarchus, on his way to
Rome; and where the ruins of the Temple of Jupiter
Serapis, bearing sea-marks at various levels and having
its columns perforated by lithodomites and containing
imbedded shells, shows how the building, by gradual
subsidence of the land, was first let down into the water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
and then by volcanic upheaval lifted again to the higher
level.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Blue Grotto
at Capri.</div>

<p>Directly in front of us as we look from our
windows, but far out over the expanse of
sunlit water, twenty-two miles away, we can see Capri,
lying like a turquoise gem on the bosom of the bay. Our
party returned from their visit to this enchanting island
with quite new conceptions of the color effects that may
be produced by the combination of sunlight and sea
water. When the steamer stops at Capri, a short distance
beyond the town of Capri, the passengers get into small
boats and are rowed up to a lofty cliff, in the base of
which, at the water level, there is a small hole, four feet
high and four feet wide, so small, indeed, that it cannot
be entered at all when the tide is up or the water is rough.
Even under favorable conditions, passengers have to sit
on the bottom of the boat and duck their heads. This
is the entrance to the wonderful Blue Grotto. "Once
within, you find yourself in an arched cavern about one
hundred and sixty feet long, one hundred and twenty
wide, and about seventy high. How deep it is no man
knows. It goes down to the bottom of the ocean. The
waters of this placid subterranean lake are the brightest,
loveliest blue that can be imagined. They are as transparent
as plate glass, and their coloring would shame the
richest sky that ever bent over Italy. No tint could be
more ravishing, no lustre more superb. Throw a stone
into the water, and the myriad of tiny bubbles that are
created flash out a brilliant glare like blue theatrical fires.
Dip an oar, and its blade turns to frosted silver, tinted
with blue. Let a man jump in, and instantly he is cased
in an armor more gorgeous than ever kingly crusader
wore." Two boys, in the scantiest possible attire, who
were standing on a ledge when we entered, clothed themselves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
repeatedly in this celestial armor for our delectation
and their profit, by diving for the pennies flung into the
water by the passengers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ascent of
Vesuvius.</div>

<p>When you visit Vesuvius, make an early
start and give yourself plenty of time. It
took our party four hours and a half, with a good team,
to drive from Naples to the foot of the steep cone at
the top. The journey takes you through some of the
disagreeable parts of the city and gives you a new impression
of its extent. When at last you do turn from
the squalid streets and begin the ascent of the mountain,
your enjoyment begins. The fresh breeze, laden with
the fragrance of orange blossoms, tempers the heat, and
at every turn of the winding, climbing road you have the
most entrancing views of the city and the bay. The
mountain itself is partly covered with the luxuriant
greenery of orchards and villas, and partly by the gloomy
beds of lava thrown out by successive eruptions&mdash;"a
black ocean, which was tumbled into a thousand fantastic
shapes&mdash;a wild chaos of ruin, desolation and barrenness&mdash;a
wilderness of billowy upheavals, of furious
whirlpools, of miniature mountains rent asunder&mdash;of
gnarled and knotted, wrinkled and twisted masses of
blackness that mimicked branching roots, great vines,
trunks of trees all interlaced and mingled together; and
all these weird shapes, all this turbulent panorama, all
this stormy, far stretching waste of blackness, with its
thrilling suggestiveness of life, of action, of boiling, surging,
furious motion, was petrified!&mdash;all stricken dead
and cold in the instant of its maddest rioting!&mdash;fettered,
paralyzed and left to glower at heaven in impotent rage
for evermore!"</p>

  <div class="caption">A WINDY DAY ON MOUNT VESUVIUS.</div>
</div>

<p>I had had the good fortune on a former visit to see
the process of its formation. At that time the lava was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
actually flowing from a breach in the side of the mountain,
a little below the cone which surrounds the great
crater, and a party of us walked over a half mile or so
among the wild rocks and congealed lava to get a sight
of it. The rocks over which we walked were too hot to
touch with the naked hand, and scorched the bottoms
of our shoes. The fumes of sulphur escaping through
the crevices made the air almost suffocating. These conditions
became more aggravated the nearer we came to
the object of our search, so that one or two of the party
became quite unnerved, gave up the expedition, and returned.
We felt like we were walking in a furnace. Then
the guide made a turn round some great boulders, and
there it was&mdash;a slowly moving stream of liquid fire,
issuing from under a great rock, and flowing down the
side of the mountain. Every one threw his hands before
his face to protect it from the blistering heat. The guide,
standing behind a big rock, reached over with a long pole
into this fearful red river and lifted out a glob of the
molten lava on the end of it, as you would dip up a bit
of hot molasses candy on the end of a fork, then, withdrawing
a little way, he disengaged the lava from the
end of the pole with a smaller stick, and, asking me for a
penny, he laid the coin on the lump of lava and pressed
it well down into the mass which rose round the edges
of the coin, holding it firmly in its place&mdash;and thus
made for me a paper weight, which is my best souvenir
of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>The ascent of the cone to the crater is next thing to
trying to climb a church steeple. Thanks to the enterprise
of Thomas Cook &amp; Sons, there is an inclined railway
which takes you from the foot of the cone up the steep
breast of the mountain nearly to the top&mdash;a dizzy ride,
one that makes you shut your eyes and grip the arms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
your seat. Then comes the worst of it&mdash;the final climb
through warm cinders ankle deep, which furnish very
bad footing and come over your shoe tops at every step.
There are rude sedan chairs on poles, and chair-bearers
who will gladly carry you up for an additional fee&mdash;and
there are often ludicrous scenes when timid ladies essay
this mode of ascent. The distance is very short, so the
ladies of our party determined to climb it themselves,
but, when about half way up, they were glad enough
to take hold of the looped ends of ropes while men at the
other end pulled, and so at last they stood on the very
top of the great volcano. Not for long, however, for,
after they had walked round the edge of the great crater
and gotten a view of the new crater, formed within, and
looking like the heaped hole of a gigantic "doodle bug,"
with its slopes made of cinders instead of sand, and
sprinkled with orange-colored sulphur, the wind veered
suddenly and swept the stifling sulphur fumes right into
their faces. They ran, coughing, back over the cinders
and down again to the upper station of the railway, fully
convinced that Vesuvius, though not perhaps so impressive,
was decidedly more pleasant at a distance than at
such close range.</p>

  <div class="caption">ON THE ROAD FROM CASTELLAMARE TO AMALFI.</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Loveliness
of Amalfi.</div>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful drive in the
world is the drive from Castellamare to
Amalfi. Castellamare is about an hour and a half by rail
from Naples, and not far from Pompeii. It was here,
indeed, that the elder Pliny lost his life in the eruption
of 79 A. D., which destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum.
Taking a wagonette there about the middle of the day,
we followed this magnificent road nearly all the afternoon,
as it wound in and out along the mountainside,
with the towering cliffs on one hand and the intensely
blue bay on the other, seen ever and anon through openings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
between the silvery olive trees which clothed all the
slopes, the view backwards being terminated by the majestic
uplift of Vesuvius, wearing a soft plum-colored
tinge that we had never seen it have before. The soil
here is wonderfully fertile, and every hillside is terraced
and cultivated with the utmost care. The orange and
lemon groves, with the trees trained over trellises and
protected from too intense heat by straw, laid on frames
above, were still blooming, though the trees were heavily
laden with green and golden fruit. Every now and then
little boys and girls from the villages which are perched
on the rocks or cling to the hillsides would run after us,
throwing nosegays into the carriage and expecting "soldi"
in return. After a while the scenery became more rugged,
not unlike Switzerland, with little waterfalls trickling
down the cliffs, and Scotch broom and other wild plants
taking the place of the vineyards and orchards on the
towering rocks. And now we begin to drive through
tunnels cut through the cliffs and to pass over solid stone
bridges, spanning glorious ravines at a dizzy height, with
the transparent sea making in far below us, and the
mountains of gray rock towering skyward above us. And
at last, in the soft evening light, we reached the culmination
of all this wonderful beauty at Amalfi. When we
stopped at the foot of the cliff on which the Cappuccini
Hotel stands, overlooking the town and the sea, we found
the uniformed portiere and other attendants in a little
lodge or office at the bottom of a long, zigzag flight of
stone steps, which leads up to the high perched hotel.
But there were sedan chairs and chair-bearers to spare
the ladies and the youngest of the children the long, lung-taxing
climb, and we were soon comfortably installed in
the most romantically situated hotel I have ever seen.
It was a Cappucin monastery once, and the cloisters are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
still there, but the cells are now used as bed-rooms. From
the windows and balconies, and from the long and lovely
arcade, covered with grape vines and lined with the most
beautiful marguerites, lilies, roses and geraniums, the
guests look down upon the picturesque little city, the
boats drawn up on the beach, the burnished Mediterranean,
and the opaline islands in the offing. And how
we Protestants did sleep in the comfortably furnished
cells of those ousted monks! Amalfi is the place I wish
to come to if I am ever again in Italy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Ruins
of Pompeii.</div>

<p>When we tore ourselves away from Amalfi,
we drove on around by Salerno, another
feast of beauty, and took the train at La Cava for Pompeii.
For days we had been reading, or re-reading, Bulwer's
<i>Last Days of Pompeii</i> with breathless interest, or
plodding through the dryer, but hardly more accurate,
details of the guide book&mdash;we had been to the museum
at Naples, where the mural paintings and other disentombed
relics of the city are shown, and we had stood
on the crater of the volcano that wrought its destruction&mdash;so
that we came to the exhumed ruins with as thorough
preparation as we had found it possible to make. But
what description can prepare one for the impression of
that appalling catastrophe which one receives when he
stands in the midst of the ruins themselves, and <i>sees</i> how
sudden and terrible the overthrow was?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i354.jpg" id="i354.jpg"></a>
  <img src="images/i354.jpg" width="600" height="452"
      alt="" />
  <div class="caption">COLONNADE OF THE HOTEL CAPPUCCINI, AMALFI.</div>
</div>

<p>Pompeii had been shattered by an earthquake sixteen
years before the final catastrophe, but the warning had
been disregarded. The place was rebuilt with lavish
outlay, and embellished with all the resources of contemporary
art, so that it was a new and splendid city which
was buried by the eruption of 79 A. D. On the 23rd of
August in that year, about two o'clock in the afternoon,
terrible detonations were heard in the mountain, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
shortly afterwards an enormous column of watery vapor
issued from the top of it, remained suspended for a time
in the air, then condensed and fell in boiling rain on
the mountain sides, creating an irresistible torrent of
mud, which quickly engulfed the city of Herculaneum.
Following this, later in the evening, apparently about
dark, came a roaring eruption of red hot pumice stones
and volcanic dust, succeeded quickly by other showers
of the same material, which covered Pompeii to the depth
of fifteen or twenty feet. Thus was the brilliant city, in
all the exuberance of its gay life, plunged into death in
a single night. And all the inhabitants of that part of
Italy believed that they were about to share the same
dreadful fate. The air was so thick that for many miles
from the volcano it was almost stifling. It is said to
have extended as far as Africa. It certainly reached as
far as Rome, and covered that city with a pall of darkness
so deep that the people took it for a sign of impending
doom. They said to each other, "The end of the world
is come! the sun is going to fall to the earth, or the
earth mount up and be set on fire by the heavens."</p>

<p>The most graphic account of the horrors of that awful
night at Pompeii is to be found in the two letters of the
younger Pliny to Tacitus. Speaking of his efforts to
remove his mother out of reach of harm, while she was
begging him to leave her to perish and save himself, he
says: "By this time the murky darkness had so increased
that one might have believed himself abroad in a black
and moonless night, or in a chamber where all the lights
had been extinguished. On every hand were heard the
complaints of women, the wailing of children, and the
cries of men. One called his father, another his son,
another his wife, and only by their voices could they know
each other. Many in their despair begged that death
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
would come and end their distress. Some implored the
gods to succor them, and some believed that this night
was the last, the eternal night which should engulf the
universe! Even so it seemed to me&mdash;and I consoled
myself for the coming death with the reflection, <i>Behold
the world is passing away!</i>"</p>

<p>No one saw the sun rise on the morrow. The clouds
of volcanic matter, still pouring their pitiless rain upon
the ruins, so darkened the sky that people could not tell
when the day came.</p>

<p>And there, under the superincumbent mass of stones
and dust, the city slept undisturbed till a few years ago,
with everything as it was in the days of Titus. "It was
like a clock that stopped when the householder died.
Meats were on the table and bread was in the oven; sentries
were in their boxes and dogs on guard at house
doors." Most of the inhabitants escaped, but it is estimated,
from the skeletons found in the ruins, that not
less than two thousand lost their lives. In the museum
by the entrance at the Marine Gate we are shown the
blackened loaves of bread, recovered from the bakeries,
the beans and eggs, the chickens and dogs, or their shapes
from the moulds they left&mdash;and, most distressing of all,
human figures. "Plaster of Paris had been poured into
the hollows where bones were found, and in all the contortion
of suffocation or convulsion appeared the forms
of men and women. How little the ones whose brawny
or whose delicate outlines we gazed upon dreamt that
they would be their own monuments to-day, and be seen
by the eyes of other races and ages, eyes curious, but not
unsympathetic! It was good to be in the warm sunshine
again. A cloud of smoke floated like a gray scarf&mdash;how
gracefully and innocently!&mdash;from Vesuvius."</p>

  <div class="caption">POMPEII.</div>
</div>

<p>We walked up the narrow streets, paved with blocks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
of hard lava, deeply rutted by chariot wheels, passing the
Basilica, the Forum, the Triumphal Arch, the temples,
the theatres, the baths, the bakeries, and the houses of
Pansa, Diomedes, and the Tragic Poet&mdash;all laid bare
and clean to the view. We had the good fortune to see
the process of excavation itself&mdash;for while most of the
city has been disentombed, some of it still remains under
the layers of small grayish white pumice stones and brown
dust. Three or four men were shovelling these away
as we passed. From most of the houses the furniture
and wall paintings have been taken away to the museums.
But in the last large residence exhumed, one which has
only recently been brought to light, nearly everything has
been left as it was, except for a new roof of mica or some
such substance, which has been built over it for its protection.
Nearly all the frescoes are as fresh as on the
day when they were painted, and the fountain in the
peristyle and its connecting pipes are so perfectly preserved
that, when the water was turned into them by
the excavators, the fountains began to play as they did
on that fateful day eighteen hundred years ago. "For
as in the days that were before the flood they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until
the flood came, and took them all away," so it was with
the careless dwellers in this opulent city&mdash;and so it is
with the careless dwellers in many an opulent city to-day.</p>

<hr class="sect" />

<p>From Naples we turned our faces homeward, taking
passage on the <i>König Albert</i>, and coming by way of
Gibraltar and the Azores. We had a delightful ship's
company, including Dr. Andrew D. White, the accomplished
ex-president of Cornell University and our late
Ambassador to Berlin, whom we found full of illuminating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
talk about Fra Paolo Sarpi and other great men and
great subjects. After a quiet and restful voyage, affording
a pleasant contrast with our experience of the preceding
summer when outward bound, we arrived at New
York on the 10th of June, 1903, deeply thankful for all
the pleasure and benefit the year had brought us, and
fully convinced that, after all, ours is the best country
in the world.</p>
